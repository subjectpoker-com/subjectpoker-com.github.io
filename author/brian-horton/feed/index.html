			<description><![CDATA[Updated 7/1/2011, 3:40 PM EDT. An article written by the Los Angeles Times is quoting lawyers from Full Tilt Poker, saying that European investors have agreed to take over a majority share in the troubled poker site. The article mentions that the investors would invest enough money in FTP to pay back players, thereby acquiring a majority stake: Attorneys associated with Full Tilt said the company signed an agreement Thursday with a group of investors who would put up enough money to pay back players and in doing so attain a majority stake in Full Tilt&#8217;s Irish parent company, Pocket Kings. The attorneys spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of ongoing negotiations with the federal prosecutors in Manhattan who brought the charges. It goes on to discuss the dismissal of the lawsuit that Phil Ivey brought against the company on May 30th: Ivey was set to withdraw his lawsuit in Nevada state court Thursday, according to his attorney David Chesnoff. &#8220;Mr. Ivey intends to dismiss his lawsuit as he believes Full Tilt is taking steps to see that the players are paid,&#8221; Chesnoff said Subject: Poker has been unable to confirm the contents of the Los Angeles Times article thus far, [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/06/ftp-sold-to-european-investors/' addthis:title='FTP Sold to European Investors?

			<description><![CDATA[The Alderney Gaming Control Commission, which supplies FTP&#8217;s licenses to offer poker games, has announced the suspension of Full Tilt Poker&#8217;s licenses.1 This means that FTP can no longer legally offer poker games through their Alderney licenses, nor can they process any deposits or withdrawals. In a press release, the AGCC issues a Hearing Notice and a Suspension Notice to Full Tilt Poker. The hearing about the matters contained in the Hearing Notice will take place on July 26th in London. The Suspension Notice means that FTP must cease to: Register new customers. Accept deposits from existing customers. Allow existing customers to withdraw funds that are held in their accounts. Permit customers to participate in any form of poker game play or gambling transaction. In a statement this morning, the AGCC said: &#8220;The decision to suspend these licenses follows a special investigation prompted by the indictments unsealed by US Attorney General’s Office in the Southern District of New York on 15th April 2011, during which grounds were found to indicate that these licensees and their business associates were operating contrary to Alderney legislation. The nature of the findings necessitated the taking of immediate action in the public interest.&#8221; Right now, players are unable to connect to [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/06/agcc-suspends-ftp-license/' addthis:title='AGCC Suspends FTP Licenses ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Subject: Poker has learned from several reliable sources of a rift in the relationship between Moneybookers and Full Tilt Poker. The dispute centers around FTP&#8217;s apparent selective processing of withdrawals to the e-wallet. Since Black Friday, Full Tilt has been disabling Moneybookers withdrawals for players from various countries in a seemingly arbitrary pattern. This has been a significant financial burden for the payment processor.1 Sources close to the situation have told Subject: Poker that Moneybookers has been in regular communication with Full Tilt Poker over this topic since April 15th, but the two companies have reportedly been unable to reach a compromise. Moneybookers has reportedly threatened to stop doing business with the poker site if the problem is not resolved quickly. Full Tilt has the ability to turn off Moneybookers withdrawals for each individual country at will. Numerous threads across the Two Plus Two Poker Forums confirm that some countries have indeed been sporadically unable to withdraw to Moneybookers. E-wallet withdrawals were quite fast before Black Friday, but since the April 15th indictments, some non-US players have been reporting delays up to several weeks. Moneybookers, based in London, is one of the largest e-wallets in the world servicing more than 18 million customers. It [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/06/dispute-between-ftp-and-moneybookers/' addthis:title='Dispute Between FTP and Moneybookers ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[We continue to see possible fallout from the new indictments handed down yesterday as the Merge Poker Network has decided to stop accepting new customers from Washington D.C., Louisiana, Missouri, and Maryland. They have also reiterated their continued desire to not accept new customers from the state of New York. Some of these states should come as no surprise, as many of them have been hostile towards online gambling. In particular, Maryland participated in handing down indictments to three people and two companies yesterday. Ten associated domains were also seized, including Bookmaker.com and Doylesroom.com. Oddly absent from the list is the state of Washington, which passed a stringent law against online gambling in 2006 and whose citizens were barred from Poker Stars and Full Tilt after the state Supreme Court upheld the law in 2010. Sources close to Merge tell us that, as of right now, Washington is not on the list of barred states. The Merge Network is still allowing users who have had accounts in the past from these states to continue playing for real money. This is similar to the recent actions of Hero Poker, which stopped accepting all US customers but allowed already registered US players to continue [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/05/merge-refusing-new-players-from-some-states/' addthis:title='Merge Refusing New Players from Some States ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>
