			<description><![CDATA[Updated 7/22/2011 4:00 EDT. Subject: Poker has received several confirmed reports that the UseMyWallet implementation QuickTender has begun paying out some customer balances. Numerous users with bank accounts in the United Kingdom and Canada have reported receiving their funds recently. The recipients reported waiting approximately two weeks for the funds to arrive. However, we have not heard any reports of customers receiving payments to bank accounts in the United States. (This is no longer the case. See update.) Currently, only users with balances that had cleared before the site went offline on May 25th have reported receiving their funds. Funds are marked as &#8220;cleared&#8221; on QuickTender&#8217;s website if they are successfully held by QuickTender and &#8220;uncleared&#8221; if they are in transit. PlusEVPoker.com reported on June 6th that funds that were uncleared as of May 25th, were frozen in intermediary banks before they reached users.1 UseMyWallet and QuickTender shut down on May 25th with little explanation, weeks after players began to notice that the site was having trouble processing payments. The company&#8217;s shut-down notice reported pessimistically, &#8220;At this time we are unable to confirm when or if we could make payments of remaining balances.&#8221; Analysis of wire transfer receipts revealed that UseMyWallet and QuickTender were associated with Chargestream Ltd, one of [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/07/umwqt-begin-repayment/' addthis:title='UMW/QT Begin Repayment ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Some tensions surrounding the May 23rd indictments may begin to ease as the UseMyWallet implementation QuickTender.com is back online and claims to be ready to process payments for previously inaccessible player funds.1 According to an e-mail that QuickTender sent to customers on June 23rd, users who want to access their funds have from July 1st to August 15th to send their banking details to the e-wallet via the &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; section of its website. QuickTender suggests that users use a bank account in euros to receive their funds as they are unable to send transfers in dollars. Current balances in dollars will be converted to euros before being sent, and QuickTender is only guaranteeing funds sent to euro accounts. On May 18th, 2011 QuickTender.com users who requested withdrawals to their bank received an email from QuickTender warning of problems with funds being frozen in transit. As a result, QuickTender stated they would stop processing withdraws. An investigation conducted by PlusEVPoker.com showed the United States Secret Service was conducting an investigation to seize money in transit to QuickTender users via correspondent banks in the United States.2 Days later on May 23rd, Maryland Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations released an [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/07/umwqt-plan-to-repay/' addthis:title='UMW/QT Plan to Repay ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>
