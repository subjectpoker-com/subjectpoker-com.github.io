			<description><![CDATA[The Alderney Gaming Control Commission, which supplies FTP&#8217;s licenses to offer poker games, has announced the suspension of Full Tilt Poker&#8217;s licenses.1 This means that FTP can no longer legally offer poker games through their Alderney licenses, nor can they process any deposits or withdrawals. In a press release, the AGCC issues a Hearing Notice and a Suspension Notice to Full Tilt Poker. The hearing about the matters contained in the Hearing Notice will take place on July 26th in London. The Suspension Notice means that FTP must cease to: Register new customers. Accept deposits from existing customers. Allow existing customers to withdraw funds that are held in their accounts. Permit customers to participate in any form of poker game play or gambling transaction. In a statement this morning, the AGCC said: &#8220;The decision to suspend these licenses follows a special investigation prompted by the indictments unsealed by US Attorney General’s Office in the Southern District of New York on 15th April 2011, during which grounds were found to indicate that these licensees and their business associates were operating contrary to Alderney legislation. The nature of the findings necessitated the taking of immediate action in the public interest.&#8221; Right now, players are unable to connect to [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/06/agcc-suspends-ftp-license/' addthis:title='AGCC Suspends FTP Licenses ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Subject: Poker is quite proud to announce that we&#8217;ve finally got ourselves a new logo! Our logo contest was unquestionably a huge success. We received a lot of really awesome logos with a wide variety of design ideas, and almost all of the entries would have made a great logo for this site. Though we were absolutely terrified to have to choose (especially considering that we don&#8217;t have good eyes for this sort of thing), one logo just stood out above the rest. You can see it looking beautiful at the top of our page. The logo was designed by Drew Scherer. He&#8217;s a graduate student studying architecture, which doesn&#8217;t surprise us, given his obvious design abilities. Before Black Friday, Drew was a NL200 six-max grinder as well. If you&#8217;d like to get in contact with Drew, you can e-mail us at team@subjectpoker.com and we&#8217;ll put you in touch with him. We&#8217;d like to express our thanks to Drew for creating this awesome logo! In fact, he deserves extra credit for also designing the sweet logo featured at the top of this announcement and on our Twitter page. So, he went above and beyond the call for us, and we [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/06/sps-new-logo/' addthis:title='S:P Has a New Logo!

			<description><![CDATA[Victory Poker players received an email from Cake Poker this morning saying their account would be upgraded to a Cake Poker account on June 1st. All rewards, gold cards, gold chips and tournament tickets will be transferred over to players&#8217; new Cake Poker accounts. Considering that Cake was already handling the software, cashier and customer support, it is unlikely that much will change for Victory Poker players. We asked the CEO, Dan Fleyshman, for comment. He told us that Cake Poker will be taking over Victory&#8217;s player base as of June 1st and that &#8220;Victory Poker will continue as a strategy/news/affiliate site for poker and non-poker related products.&#8221; When asked why they are transferring their players to Cake, Dan Fleyshman said: &#8220;I&#8217;m just emotionally done with continuing as a poker site after #Blackfriday ripped the heart out of the US market which I loved.&#8221; Victory Poker focused much of its marketing on the US market, but two days after Black Friday they chose to pull out of the US. In the interview with Dan Fleyshman that we published last week, he did not mention that they were considering shutting down altogether. Players received the following email, which was first posted [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/05/victory-poker-to-move-all-players-to-cake-poker/' addthis:title='Victory Poker to Move All Players to Cake Poker ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Most recent update: 5/23 11:45 PM EST. A Maryland federal grand jury indicted two more online gambling businesses today. Subject: Poker has not yet received the full indictment, but an affidavit from a Maryland Homeland Security special agent reveals many of the details of the case. Charged in the affidavit are two companies and their owners: ThrillX Systems Ltd., owned by Darren Wright and David Parchomchuk and K23 Financial Services (BMX Entertainment), run by Ann Marie Puig. The charges include running an illegal gambling business and money laundering. These charges are noteworthy because bank fraud is absent. Ten domain names and eleven bank accounts were seized in six different countries. Here is the full list of seized domain names: Bookmaker.com Truepoker.com Doylesroom.com Beted.com Betehorse.com Betgrandesports.com Goldbnarchcasino.com Funtimebingo.com 2Betdsi.com The Baltimore Sun reports that the domains were meant to be changed to a banner announcing the seizures by mid-afternoon Monday, but that they have not yet been changed.1 The affidavit reveals that the government conducted an undercover operation, starting their own payment processor named &#8220;Linwood Payment Solutions&#8221;. Undercover agents met with top managers of gambling organizations, recording those meetings. Linwood then processed millions of dollars in transactions during the past two years for [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/05/more-gambling-domains-seized/' addthis:title='BREAKING: More Gambling Domains Seized Upd. 9 ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[American citizen Bradley Franzen pleaded guilty this afternoon to charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, accepting funds in connection with unlawful internet gambling and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The April 15th indictment describes Franzen as a middleman between poker sites and payment processors: 10. From at least in or about 2007, up to and including on or about March 2011, BRADLEY FRANZEN, the defendant, worked with internet gambling companies including the Poker Companies, to identify Poker Processors willing to process payments for the Poker Companies, including through deceptive means. In this capacity, FRANZEN acted as an intermediary between principals of the Poker Companies, including defendants BRENT BECKLEY and NELSON BURTNICK, and the Poker Processors. According to the Department of Justice press release announcing the indictment, Franzen could be facing a total of 30 years in prison: Up to 20 years in prison for the conspiracy to commit money laundering. Up to 5 years in prison for conspiracy to commit bank fraud and to accept funds in connection with unlawful internet gambling.

			<description><![CDATA[The CEO of Hero Poker announced early Saturday that Hero Poker, a Merge Gaming skin, will no longer be accepting new players from the United States after May 25th. Existing players will continue being able to play. Hero Poker claims to have made this decision in order for them to keep providing their players with high levels of personal support. To quote the CEO&#8217;s response to a player : &#8220;This is not a set back [sic], its [sic] for us to provide better service and I know this goes contrary to what most site would do, but I&#8217;d rather work out really establishing our boutique level service systematically with our core players and then roll that out. I&#8217;ve said it before, if I have to chose [sic] standards and prioritizing my players over growth, then I will. I have two major markets that I have full marketing teams for which are on stand by, so my work load really isn&#8217;t going to change.&#8221; It is unclear why they specifically chose to close sign-ups from the US, since players from elsewhere would seemingly require similar levels of support. We have contacted Hero Poker&#8217;s CEO for comment and will publish an update [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/05/hero-poker-to-stop-us-sign-ups/' addthis:title='Hero Poker to Stop US Sign-Ups ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The current poker news landscape is dominated by sites and magazines whose bottom lines depend directly on the news makers, which naturally leads to bias. There are some smaller independent outfits, but these tend to be driven mostly by opinion, gossip, and rumors, and they have their own biases. Many people simply bypass the poker media completely and instead wade through the Two Plus Two Forums. While 2+2 provides a wonderful resource, it is a discussion forum and not a news site and is thus difficult and time-consuming as a news source. It&#8217;s also nearly impossible for people who aren&#8217;t extremely well-acquainted with the subtleties of 2+2 to separate signal from noise. As a result, at a time when the poker world is attempting to absorb immense quantities of complicated and important news, the community is starved for good information and solid analysis. Enter Subject: Poker. S:P has a very simple goal, embodied by our slogan: &#8220;Poker news done right.&#8221; A lot of thought has gone into how to provide you, our readers, with the best possible poker news site. We&#8217;ll describe a small subset of our many important founding principles here: Independence First and foremost, Subject: Poker is completely independent.

			<description><![CDATA[You may have noticed that there&#8217;s a hideous void at the top of this page. Indeed, we&#8217;re a site without a logo. And frankly, it&#8217;s a bit embarrassing. We&#8217;re reporters, analysts, poker players, and many other things, but unfortunately, we are not artists. So, we&#8217;re reaching out to the community for help on this one and holding a contest to see who can design us the best logo. We know that a lot of you have some pretty awesome design skills, and we&#8217;re excited to see what you come up with. We ask that you please include our full name (colon and all), and we&#8217;d love it if you could fit our slogan, &#8220;Poker news done right,&#8221; in there, though that&#8217;s not a requirement. The only real advice that we have is to keep it simple and sleek. (As you can see by our fairly minimalist theme, we don&#8217;t want our design to distract from our content.) To submit an entry, e-mail it to team@subjectpoker.com. The creator of the best entry will be featured in an announcement on the site showcasing his or her logo. More importantly, the winner gets a permanent mention on our About Subject: Poker page and, [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/05/subject-poker-logo-contest/' addthis:title='Subject: Poker Logo Contest ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>
