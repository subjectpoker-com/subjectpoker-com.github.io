			<description><![CDATA[Ivey v. Tiltware was dismissed on Thursday, June 30 2011. Online records Subject: Poker acquired from the Clark County Courthouse website indicate the case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by the plaintiff. Ivey, a member of Team Full Tilt who owns a piece of the poker site, filed the lawsuit against Tiltware, one of the many companies behind the Full Tilt brand, on June 1st.1 The principal complaint appeared to be related to Ivey&#8217;s non-compete agreement, which the plaintiff alleged was overly strict and was preventing him from finding work. The lawsuit was preceeded by a statement from Phil Ivey, complaining that his reputation had been harmed by Full Tilt&#8217;s inability to pay US players. Full Tilt responded shortly afterwards with a remarkably angry statement, alleging that Ivey was hindering the process of returning player funds. But, on June 24th, we reported that Ivey had recently been in Ireland to meet with Full Tilt executives, where he appeared to be in good spirits and on good terms with his colleagues. This, together with the confirmed voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit without prejudice, suggests that relations between Ivey and the poker site have healed. Indeed, yesterday, The Los Angeles Times reported that Ivey’s [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/07/ivey-lawsuit-dismissed/' addthis:title='Ivey Lawsuit Dismissed ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[As we’ve seen in the last couple months, the US Attorneys like to release statements with all of their indictments which lay out the charges, identify the defendants and give credit to the law enforcement agencies and individuals who conducted the investigation. The most recent indictments proved no different. This press release was certainly telling. In it, four distinct agencies (three federal and the state of Maryland) were identified as having participated in the investigation of the indicted persons and sites.  All three of the federal agencies offered statements summarizing their involvement in the investigation, stating why that specific agency felt it was important these alleged criminals be brought to justice. These “policy statements” of the different groups offer insight into why they&#8217;re involved and can give assistance in guessing what actions law enforcement will take going forward. US Attorney for the District of Maryland &#8220;It is illegal for internet gambling enterprises to do business in Maryland, regardless of where the website operator is located,” said U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein. “We cannot allow foreign website operators to flout the law simply because their headquarters are based outside the country.&#8221; The basis of his statements is quite simple: These individuals were [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/05/inside-the-press-release/' addthis:title='Inside the Press Release ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I have only had a brief time to look at the indictments, and I intend to offer a more thorough analysis of each indictment, as well as the affidavit, in the coming days as we learn more. Here are my early thoughts, though: The first indictment is against K23 Group Financial Services, doing business as BMX Entertainment, and Ann Marie Puig. The second indictment alleges charges against Thrillix Systems, Ltd, doing business as BetED.com, Darren Wright, and David Parchomchuk. Both indictments, seem to contain the same interesting language. Count One – Conducting Illegal Gambling Business This count (with emphasis, spacing, and numbering added for clarity) alleges that the defendants did knowingly and unlawfully conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct and own all or part of an illegal gambling business, to wit, a gambling business involving online sportsbetting, which gambling business was in violation of the laws of the State of Maryland&#8230; and which involved five or more persons who: conducted, financed, managed, supervised, directed and owned all or part of said illegal gambling business, and which has remained in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days. 18 U.S.C. §§1955 and 2. These references federal statute 18 U.S.C.
