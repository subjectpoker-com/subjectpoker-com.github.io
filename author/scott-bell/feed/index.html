			<description><![CDATA[Correction posted 11:45 PM EST. Subject: Poker&#8217;s Scott Bell has learned that Absolute Poker and Ultimate Bet&#8217;s total outstanding debt to players is $53.7 million, but their cash on hand is only between $5 million and $6 million. These numbers came from a reliable source inside of AP management and have been corroborated by a different person inside a different department in the company. Our source, who wishes to remain anonymous, told us that $29.5 million of this liability is to US players. He explained that this number had been artificially lowered by US players systematically moving money to non-US accounts in an attempt to get their money off of the site sooner. He said that such attempts would not be successful. The $5 million to $6 million figure, which is not exact, takes into account about $3 million in severance pay to Cereus&#8217;s Costa Rican employees.1 It does not include money that was frozen when some of Cereus&#8217;s bank accounts were seized by the United States Department of Justice on April 15th.2 This news certainly does not bode well for players who have money on Cereus. Since Black Friday, non-US players have been able to slowly cash out funds, in amounts [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/06/cereus-owes-players-54m-has-only-5m-6m/' addthis:title='Cereus Owes $54M, Has $5M-$6M Liquid ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Confusion surrounds sister sites Ultimate Bet and Absolute Poker post Black Friday, converging from multiple angles and leaving players to guess at what is and what isn&#8217;t. With high-profile legal firm Blank Rome directing UB and AP to say as little as necessary after the indictment, corporate headquarters has remained largely silent. The company waited six days after the indictment before releasing any statement, and this merely named legal counsel. They&#8217;ve provided only vague language about player funds and the future. As a result of this effective silence, even basic questions like where UB/AP corporate offices are located remain unanswered, let alone more important questions like the viability of the sites or the whereabouts of player funds. And, though a cohesive and understandable message is not forthcoming from the company, significant information has leaked from inside sources, painting a picture of a company engaged in numerous complex internal struggles. Meanwhile, player funds hang in the balance. The Madeira Fjord AS Feud On May 1st, a nasty shareholder dispute became public with dual articles in the St. Petersburg Times and long-standing Norwegian news bastion, Dagens Næringsliv. These reveal the story and struggle of the shareholders of Madeira Fjord AS (and Portuguese subsidiary Avoine), a Norway-based firm built to house early [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/05/ub-and-ap-since-black-friday/' addthis:title='UB and AP Since Black Friday ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>
