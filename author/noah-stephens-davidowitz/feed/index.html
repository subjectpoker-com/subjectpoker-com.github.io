			<description><![CDATA[Subject: Poker will not be publishing any more articles. Currently, Thomas Bakker and I are starting a poker security consulting company.1 As a result, I can no longer guarantee my independence as editor-in-chief. Subject: Poker&#8216;s founding principle is independence, so it would be inappropriate for me to continue Subject: Poker. The website will stay up with all articles intact for the foreseeable future, but it will naturally become a bit of a relic as time passes and no new articles are added. I hope that it will continue to prove a useful resource for the poker community. Diamond Flush has decided to start a new poker news site, Diamond Flush Poker. Diamond has been an incredible member of our team who&#8217;s written many of our most important articles, including the first story to mention Full Tilt&#8217;s french investor; our story correcting the AGCC&#8217;s false numbers; all stories related to the pending deal between GBT, FTP, and the DOJ; our recent story exposing Chris Ferguson&#8217;s secret bank accounts; and many others. DFP will be inheriting much of our data, sources, and research as well. We look forward to getting our news from there, and we recommend that our readers do the same.

			<description><![CDATA[On Monday, Judge Leonard Sand of the Southern District of New York dismissed many of the claims raised in a class action lawsuit against Full Tilt Poker, many of its companies, many of its owners, and others associated with the organization. The suit, which was originally filed on June 30th on behalf of all US players, lists thirteen individual defendants: Ray Bitar, Nelson Burtnick, Howard Lederer, Phil Ivey, Chris Ferguson, John Juanda, Jennifer Harman-Traniello, Phil Gordon, Erick Lindgren, Erik Seidel, Andy Bloch, Mike Matusow, Gus Hansen, Allen Cunningham, and Patrik Antonius. (Phil Gordon was later dismissed with prejudice.) It also names nine companies associated with Full Tilt and lists 100 John Does to allow for more people and companies to be added in the future. It alleges that all defendants committed conversion and that Burtnick, Bitar, and various corporate entities violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Motions to dismiss are pretrial motions that ask the court to reject a case on purely legal grounds. A judge&#8217;s response to a motion to dismiss typically says nothing about the facts of the case, but rather merely says whether the plaintiff&#8217;s claims against the defendant, if true, would justify a legal remedy. The granting of a motion [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2012/02/judge-dismisses-ftp-class-actio/' addthis:title='Judge Dismisses Most of FTP Class Action ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Correction posted 1/18/2011 12:18 AM EST. Eight poker pros and alleged victims of the Ultimate Bet superuser scandal have filed a civil suit against Excapsa Software, Inc., the company behind Ultimate Bet until 2006.1 The plaintiffs are Daniel &#8220;Ashman&#8221; Ashman, Brad Booth, Thomas &#8220;tommyboy83&#8243; Koral, Greg &#8220;Captain Zeebo&#8221; Laverly, Dave Lizmi, Daniel &#8220;King Dan&#8221; Smith, Joseph Sanders, and Dustin &#8220;Neverwin&#8221; Woolf. They claim to have together suffered damages of over $2,000,000, though the complaint only specifies the ownership of $1,734,863.50.2 The complaint argues that Ultimate Bet&#8217;s repayments to victims were inadequate and that the victims are entitled to a thorough accounting.3 It lists eight separate causes of action: violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; conversion; interference with prospective economic advantage; intentional infliction of emotional distress; unfair business practices (as defined by California Business and Professions Code 17200-17210); fraud; and negligence. Because this is a civil RICO lawsuit, the plaintiffs ask for treble damages. They also request compensation for attorneys&#8217; fees, trebled costs of investigation, and $10 million in punitive damages. In addition to Excapsa, the complaint lists ten John Does as defendants, whom it identifies as unknown &#8220;owners, operators, officers, employees, and/or agents [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2012/01/superuser-lawsuit/' addthis:title='Superuser Scandal Victims Sue Old UB ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[A large amount of personal data about UB players has been leaked. The data, which was posted publicly on the internet, appears to contain information about every player with an account at Ultimate Bet. Subject: Poker estimates that roughly 3.5 million accounts are affected. Accounts on UB&#8217;s sister site, Absolute Poker, are not included. The leaked data includes the following: Full name Screen name E-mail address Phone number Mailing address Account balance IP address Deposit methods used (e.g. &#8220;echeck&#8221;) Birth date Account number (unique identifier for UB accounts, not bank accounts numbers) VIP status Affiliate status Blacklist status A link to the data was posted on the Two Plus Two Poker Forums by an anonymous poster who removed the link eight minutes later. This is the only such public posting that we know of, but in that brief time period, enough people saw the link that it is currently being passed around privately. Subject: Poker confirmed the accuracy of the data against known information. For example, the author&#8217;s private information is included and correct (though it is now outdated). We looked up a small number of known accounts, and we were unable to find anyone with a UB account whose personal details [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/12/ub-data-leak/' addthis:title='Large Amounts of Personal Data Leaked from UB (Update: Site down) ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The Merge Gaming Network has quietly announced plans to start taking new US player sign-ups tomorrow at 12:01 AM EDT. Some Merge skins have contacted affiliates with the news, and some have responded to players&#8217; inquiries to confirm. Merge, currently the second largest poker network that serves US players according to PokerScout.com, stopped accepting new US sign-ups over four months ago. Multiple sources close to the situation said at the time that the measure was a temporary response to better prepare the network for the large influx of new traffic resulting from Black Friday. Since the decision, Merge&#8217;s traffic has actually dropped to roughly its pre-Black Friday levels according to PokerScout.com. Multiple sources close to Merge tell Subject: Poker that new players from Washington DC and six states will not be able to sign up: Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, New York, and Washington. All seven of these jurisdictions have relatively strict anti-gambling laws. Merge stopped accepting new players from four of these jurisdictions on May 24th, the day after the US Attorney for the District of Maryland seized assets from a number of gambling websites. Kentucky and Washington, both of which have very strict anti-gambling laws, are new to the list. In communications with [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/10/merge-accepts-us/' addthis:title='Merge to Accept New US Players Tomorrow ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Updated 10/2 at 9:09 AM EDT. The United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York has released a statement clarifying its position with regard to Full Tilt Poker and players who are owed money by the site. Though the statement makes no commitments, it is remarkable in that it discusses the possibility of the DOJ compensating players directly: After the amended complaint in United States v. Pokerstars et al., 11 Civ. 2564 (LBS), was filed on September 22, 2011, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York received a number of new inquiries from individuals regarding the recovery of their funds from Full Tilt Poker. By way of background, in April of 2011, this Office entered into a domain-name use agreement with Full Tilt Poker. That agreement, among other things, expressly authorized Full Tilt Poker to return player funds to players. However, as the September 22 amended complaint alleges, Full Tilt Poker did not in fact have player funds on hand to return to players. Instead, the amended complaint alleges that Full Tilt Poker had, among other things, (a) transferred significant amounts of players’ real money deposits to principals of the company, while (b) [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/09/doj-ftp-statement/' addthis:title='DOJ Releases Statement about FTP (Updated) ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[After a three-month-long suspension, the Alderney Gambling Control Commission has revoked the licenses of three of Full Tilt Poker&#8217;s four Alderney licensed companies.1 In a detailed notice, the AGCC provided its rationale for taking these actions. The notice outlines many alleged violations of AGCC regulations by the three former licensees and one current licensee, and concludes that some or all of them were guilty of seven such violations on a balance of probabilities: No longer financially fit and proper- Vantage, Filco, and Oxalic Association with Kolyma Corporation AVV, which is no longer fit and proper- All Failure to notify the AGCC of the &#8220;serious incidents&#8221; of DOJ seizures and frozen accounts- Vantage and Filco Failure to repay customers upon request- Vantage Failure to ensure sufficient funds- Vantage, Filco, and Oxalic Loans to players2- Vantage Inaccurate or falsified accounting records- Vantage, Filco, Oxalic The AGCC&#8217;s notice stresses both Full Tilt&#8217;s insolvency and its alleged false communications with the commission. Indeed the report details numerous false statements allegedly made by FTP to the AGCC, including assurances that the company did not loan money to players and accounting documents that included money loaned to players as part of the shortfall, money seized by the United [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/09/agcc-revoked-ftps-licenses/' addthis:title='AGCC Revokes FTP&#8217;s Licenses ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Tom &#8220;durrrr&#8221; Dwan is one of the best-known players of nosesbleed-stakes poker and the newest member of Team Full Tilt. On April 16th, his friend Phil Galfond decided to guarantee $1 million of Stars and Full Tilt payouts to players, and Dwan decided to match it. Dwan has since raised this to the amount that he earned in sponsorship money from Full Tilt Poker, an amount that he says is higher than $1 million. He had otherwise been relatively quiet about Full Tilt until the DOJ amended their civil complaint on Tuesday to include requests for damages from Howard Lederer, Chris Ferguson, and Rafe Furst and provide much more information about why Full Tilt has so far failed to repay players. Now, he says that he is freed from an NDA and able to talk freely. Before starting this interview, Dwan asked me to ask him probing questions. He explained that, though he would not answer every question, he wanted to be as candid as possible and was comfortable refusing to answer when he felt it was necessary. The Interview Three questions came up that, for reasons explained in the interview, Dwan was not comfortable answering extemporaneously at the time: [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/09/tom-dwan-ftp-interview/' addthis:title='Interview with Tom &#8220;durrrr&#8221; Dwan about FTP ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Most recent update: 9/20 at 4:37 PM EDT. The US Department of Justice has amended its Black Friday civil complaint to include discussion of alleged &#8220;Full Tilt Poker&#8217;s and the FTP insider defendants&#8217; theft of player funds.&#8221; The new complaint adds three new defendants, Howard Lederer, Chris Ferguson, and Rafe Furst. It also alleges that these new defendents together with Ray Bitar committed money laundering, and asks for penalties ranging from $12M for Furst to $42M for Lederer. A memorandum summarizing the amendment says, The Amended Complaint alleges that one of the Poker Companies, Full Tilt Poker, not only engaged in the operation of an unlawful gambling business, bank fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering as alleged in the Complaint, but also defrauded its poker players by misrepresenting to players that funds deposited into their online player accounts were secure and segregated from operating funds, while at the same time using player funds to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars to Full Tilt Poker owners. Full Tilt Poker was able to accomplish this massive fraud, in part, because it illegally conducted business in the United States but maintained its personnel, operations, assets, and accounts principally overseas. The new complaint also contains detailed [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/09/ftp-civil-amended/' addthis:title='BREAKING: DOJ&#8217;s Civil Complaint Amended, Alleges FTP Stole Player Funds (Update 7) ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York has agreed to release an unspecified amount of money to PokerStars. The agreement does not say how much money has been released. Instead, it says only that the DOJ has agreed to release all funds in a particular Luxembourgish account except for $5.5 million. It explains that the $5.5 million was derived from the real money play of US players. Presumably, the remaining funds in the account were released because they were demonstrably not derived from US players. The account, one of the many listed as subject to forfeiture as part of the April 15th civil complaint is held in Bank Hapoalim Luxemburg in the name of Sphene International, a company which held many of the accounts seized. Before April 15th, Sphene received deposits and processed withdrawals for PokerStars players both in and out of the United States. It is unclear at this time what, if anything, caused this account to receive special attention from SDNY and PokerStars.1 Perhaps this account has some unique feature that allowed PokerStars to secure the release of some of its funds, or perhaps this agreement will be the first of many. Subject: Poker will continue investigating this issue, and we will report what we learn.
