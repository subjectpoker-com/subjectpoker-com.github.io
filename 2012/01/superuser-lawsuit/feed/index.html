			<description>I think you are over reacting to a fairly common occurrence in lawsuits: Asking for the maximum damages you can possibly justify. Think about it: If a company steals 2 million dollars from a group of people, is it more likely they will win 2 million + legal fees + actual legitimate damages from the theft by asking for 10 million or asking for 2 million? You also have to remember that it will be the actual theft + legal fees + damages, as the correct resolution would not only restore the theft to the victims, but also compensate them for the stress of the trial, the length of time the money was stolen (and in a perfect world the &quot;risk&quot; that the thieves would have gotten away with it, though that&#039;s probably not a part of the legal system). They might start at 10 million and settle for 3 or 4 million and that is perfectly reasonable to my eyes. Bottom line, UB stole, lied about it, got caught lying, lied some more and continue to lie. Hopefully the victims of the thefts can at least get some of their money back.</description>

			<description>When I started reading the article, I had no problem with the additional lawsuit filed by people who were cheated out of their money. However, when I saw the &quot;treble damages&quot; (triple damages) and $10 million in punitive damages, these greedy bastards are trying to cash in for over $15 million when being cheated out of less than $2 million. It is for this reason I HOPE THEY LOSE and Ultimate Bet prevails and I don&#039;t even like Ultimate Bet. By asking for almost 10X their actual damages, these greedy plantiffs have turned what was a very reasonable lawsuit into an ambulance chasing scheme.</description>

			<description>You say that as though there were never any cheating at live games. I did not play on UB (specifically because of their reputation), but in general I felt like I was getting a much fairer shake by playing on-line than by playing live, even in a casino.</description>

			<description>IN 2006 I WAS PLAYING 2-5 NO LIMIT AT THE BELLAGIO. I SAT NEXT TO A YOUNG MAN WHO HAPPENED TO WORK FOR THE COMPANY THAT INSTALLED ONLINE WEB SERVERS IN THE CANADIAN TRIBAL LANDS FOR VARIOUS ENTITIES IN AND OUT OF CANADA. I TOLD HIM OUTRGHT THAT I DID NOT TRUST ANY ONLINE POKER SITE AND THAT I WOULD NEVER PLAY ON ANY SUCH SITE. I TOLD HIM THAT THERE WERE MANY WAYS IN WHICH ONLINE PLAYERS WOULD BE CHEATED BY THE ONILINE SITES DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY SUCH AS BY THE ONLINE SITE ITSELF, ITS EMPLOYEES OR BY THIRD PARTIES. HE WAS &quot;ABSOLUTE&quot; IN SPEAKING OUT FOR THE THE INTEGRITY OF THE ONLINE SITES. WELL GUESS WHAT? WHEN YOU COMBINE MONEY AND GREED THE CHEATING OF THE PLAYERS IS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. UP TO THAT TIME I HAD WORKED SEVERAL YEARS AS A PATENT ATTORNEY RESEARCHING MANY MANY PATENTS RELATING TO ONLINE POKER SYSTEMS. I KNEW WHAT COULD BE CONCEIVED AND PRACTICED BY POTENTIAL CHEATERS. WITH RESPECT TO THIS NEW LAWSUIT, THE DISCOVERY PROCESS WILL GENERATE MANY USEFUL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS THAT WILL SINK MANY OTHER PERSONS OTHER THAN YOU KNOW WHO &quot;RH&quot;. THAT&#039;S WHEN THE YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HIT THE FAN.</description>

			<description>&quot;Not many people outside of those mentioned in the lawsuit care about someone suing UB.&quot; That isn&#039;t an opinion. It is speculation about a matter of fact, one which I suspect is very untrue. How does this hurt you other than for like 1.5 seconds when you think the update was about you? It&#039;s not like SP was humming and hawing about posting an update on FTP and decided, &quot;Nah, let&#039;s write about UB instead!&quot; You&#039;ve lost nothing here.</description>

			<description>Speak for yourself, I hope UB has more pain coming their way. As always Subject sticks to their principles and does another nice job. Thanks.</description>

			<description>you should stick to stories on FTP or maybe anything to do with legislation IMAO. Not many people outside of those mentioned in the lawsuit care about someone suing UB.</description>
