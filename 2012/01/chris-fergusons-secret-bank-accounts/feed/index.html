			<description>Also, some of the players could be held accountable. I personally overdrew bank accounts thinking that the funds would be deposited and then when my parents closed the bank accounts the funds were never collected by FTP. I feel powerless as to how my $4000 or so can affect the entire repayment process, but I hope that at least by stepping forward it can be recognized that the onus is on all of us, myself certainly included and not least the government for restricting access to playing poker in the first place.</description>

			<description>As someone who has played Full Tilt Poker extensively (and lost), this is definitely NOT a Ponzi Scheme. Mismanagement of resources, yes, but to call it a Ponzi Scheme is false.</description>

			<description>This does just get messier as time goes on. Its something to point out, all the people responsible should be funnelling the money back to the players. Its the players who are all out of pocket because of this.</description>

			<description>Realist who knows very little, The whole article went right over your head. You probably never heard about washing clothes or been to the laundry, or even thought about the laundry process. Right. Ferguson, the calculating math genius must have decided to trust a bunch of rounders with Full Tilt&#039;s finances, the naive gullible fish that he is.</description>

			<description>Where you see innocence, I see negligence. Everyone who took substantial funds from FTP is proportionally guilty and morally responsible for player funds until such time as the players are made whole.</description>

			<description>This article says more good than bad about Chris Ferguson as far as I am concerned or have I misunderstood this article and its contents? At least he has paid money towards the running costs and possibly some player repayments since BF (why havent any of the others) He hasnt takenor received his full share of dividend money whilst all the other shareholders have done so. Most importantly and highly significantly he has bought out other shareholders and lent some money against their shareholdings. If he did this at inflated valuations of the FTP companies then it strongly suggests to me that he was not aware of the true financial situation at the company and that others (namely Ray Bitar) hid the true state of affairs from him. If he knew the company wasnt making sufficient profits to warrant the excessive dividend payments why would he buy out and lend money at a greater than fair rate relative to the true value? Couple this with reports from employees that he appeared to take very little interest in the running of the company and I think it becomes clear that maybe he could just be an innocent victim in all this and has a solid defence against the accusations against him and the uninformed and quite likely unjustified vitriol being directed at him in the above comments. I believe that this interpretation of the article in relation to Chris Ferguson would be a fairer and more realistic one to draw than the united and universal hatred of him relayed in the comments above.</description>
