			<description>Hello Would it be possible to have some more understandable cliffs for us NON-US people who might find this text difficult to understand because of all the legal language? For me its difficult to understad exactly what this article says, because I am not familiar with the legal terms. I know there are links, but thought maybe it would be possible to write some cliffs of some sort which might be a litle more understandable.</description>
