			<description>Phil Ivey, last I recall, owned 5% of the site ... at &quot;perhaps&quot; the top of the market, his worth was $70M (when the site was obviously worth $1.4B, on the british exchange) ... his net worth was $140M (50p from FTP and 50p from poker winnings) ... not sure what his total net worth is now.</description>

			<description>Even if FTP becomes functional again, they would be at loss with a huge trust deficit. How many of us will return to FTP? Not I. I am with 888poker - safe, secure, trustworthy and risk free. No FTP anymore. I lost some there ..but this is the end of the road for FTP.</description>
