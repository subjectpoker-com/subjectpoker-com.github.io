			<description>A) Moneypak? Nothing like carrying cash to the CVS. B) Why not just add an option to the ATM, lol. Have a PLUS system casino DEBIT card. C) DEBIT/CHECK Card - Remember, they don&#039;t want people going into DEBT, but using a DEBIT card doesn&#039;t apply. Same rules apply in PA - you can buy lottery tickets with a DEBIT card (PIN purchase) but not a CREDIT card*. * = Many stores aren&#039;t advanced enough to know one type from another.</description>

			<description>Hi Mr. Hasselhoff, All bills must go through the house and the Senate to become law. However, just to clarify, this bill probably won&#039;t go through on its own. It will likely be attached to another bill. The bill has &lt;a href=&quot;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR02366:@@@P&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;eleven cosponsors&lt;/a&gt; right now, is bipartisan, and counts some fairly powerful congressman amongst its cosponsors. In particular, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will presumably support the bill, though he&#039;s obviously quite busy with other things and hasn&#039;t commented yet. Some important people who are historical enemies of ours are Senator Jon Kyl and Congressman Bachus (chairman of Financial Services), but both of them have recently expressed a willingness to consider poker-only legislation. Lots of important people&#039;s positions on this are simply unknown, such as Congressman Fred Upton (chairman of Energy and Commerce, the bill&#039;s primary committee), House Majority Leader Boehner, House Minority Leader Pelosi, and Senate Minority Leader McConnel. I think maybe we&#039;ll write up a feature article talking about the various people involved in this and what has to happen for this to pass. FWIW, I don&#039;t think anyone really thinks it&#039;s a favorite to pass. The Harrah&#039;s/Caesars/WSOP company-of-many-names is quite likely to be involved. Steve Wynn (i.e. the Wynn Casino) formed a bit of a partnership with Stars before Black Friday, but since has canceled. I would assume that he&#039;s still interested in online poker should such legislation pass. All the major casinos are a possibility, as are some of the larger racetracks. The California card rooms might come into the market as well, depending on what happens with the pending intrastate legislation in California.</description>

			<description>Couple of questions: Does this bill have to get through both the House and Senate? Are there any indications of how much support their is in Congress for this bill? Which entities would be the presumed front runners to take over the US iPoker market? I assume Harrah&#039;s/Caesar&#039;s/The Rio?</description>

			<description>Keep in mind that there&#039;s a difference between a debit card and a credit card. The card that you typically get from your bank when you open a checking account is not technically a credit card.. It&#039;s a debit card.</description>

			<description>The bill doesn&#039;t say that they can&#039;t allow international players. That would likely be left up to regulators if it passed.</description>

			<description>Thanks for the quick synopsis. While I doubt the bill will make it unchanged through Congress it is a much better law than last year&#039;s Reid Bill.</description>

			<description>In the bill, they talk about significant vendors, which includes payment processors, but I believe could also include e-wallets. Maybe we&#039;ll get some of those back.</description>

			<description>Thanks for linking the text of the bill. I&#039;m almost done :). Sweating the timetable is going to be excruciating. International players are not excluded in the bill, but sites could do whatever they want. I don&#039;t see why they&#039;d want to exclude more players though.</description>

			<description>There are other ways to deposit other than credit card right now.....EChecks, bank wire transfers, Western Union. All of these methods are much more secure than a charge card transaction. I&#039;m assuming this is also part of the added security that this bill promotes.</description>
