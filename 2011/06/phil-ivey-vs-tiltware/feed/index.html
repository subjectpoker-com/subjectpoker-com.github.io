			<description>A a Hell&#039;s Angel. If you&#039;re curious the story behind that is pretty crazy. HA&#039;s stormed Harrah&#039;s in Laughlin, NV as a rival motorcycle club was in force there (Mongol&#039;s). After a barrage of guns, hammers, chains, even an axe...3 men were dead and dozens injured. All in the middle of the day and right on the casino floor. There&#039;s lot&#039;s of video of it from security cameras, in fact the video was used extensively in identifying and charging most of the participants.</description>

			<description>Sorry, I misread that. The reason I thought Ivey was aware of the warnings was because he included them in his complaint, but presumably he was aware of them only after BF. And yes, the DOJ may have issued warnings before investing heavily in the case. Just not seen it mentioned elsewhere.</description>

			<description>This was just a small legal point to clarify your excellent summary of the lawsuit. Just one of those arcane legal procedures that keep us lawyers employed! And to clarify, there could be more defendants added later, if evidence supports it. Parties get added &amp; dropped rather routinely, particularly when dealing with affiliated corporations. For example, it wouldn&#039;t be shocking to see Bitar, Lederer, Pocket Kings, etc. get added as parties depending on how Full Tilt (errr, TiltWare) defends the case. In fact, this case may give poker players a peek behind the Byzantine Tilt corporate structure.</description>

			<description>Steve, The complaint says that Ivey was NOT aware of the DOJ&#039;s warnings. It&#039;s not hard to imagine that the DOJ would warn someone that they were breaking the law and ask them to stop before prosecuting them, especially when the laws being broken are fairly complex.</description>

			<description>So every informed online poker player in the world was aware of the hoops being jumped through to get U.S. players&#039; deposits and payments processed - except for Phil Ivey? However he *was* aware of the DOJ&#039;s repeated warnings and clear notice. Hmmm... Does anyone have any further information about these clear warnings and notice? Why would the DOJ do that? &quot;Hey guys, we&#039;re assembling this secret, expensive case to sue you for billions but if you stop allowing Americans to play with you, we&#039;ll throw it all in the trash?&quot; That makes sense, right? I am shocked that Phil is jeopardizing the return of thousands of ordinary Joes&#039; funds apparently in order to enhance his own saleability and put a few more million in his pocket. It seems so out of character. Has he picked up some unsavoury advisors? But he&#039;s the greatest poker player in the world, right? Whatever the leeches may have advised him to do, he must have planned his hand, surely? His reputation has been harmed to the tune of $150 million? Maybe there&#039;s still more to this but for the time being I feel that, to paraphrase Phil himself, &#039;Phil Ivey’s reputation has been irreparably harmed by&#039; *Phil Ivey&#039;s* actions.&#039;</description>

			<description>Don&#039;t read too much into the &quot;Unknown&quot; defendants. In some jurisdictions this is standard practice to make it easier to bring in more parties later. It doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that there will be more defendants or that Ivey is in the dark about Tilt&#039;s corporate structure. Most likely, his contract was solely with TiltWare, and they will be the primary if not sole defendant,</description>

			<description>Hell, if Phil Ivey gets his money, then the U.S. players won&#039;t get squat unless he pays them himself. Glad I played on Pokerstars, but feel sorry for the Full Tilt players.</description>
