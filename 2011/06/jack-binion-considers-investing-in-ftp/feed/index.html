			<description>Ray Bitar shouldn&#039;t have to step down. He&#039;s only indicted in the US, not in Ireland or any of the other countries where they are licensed. Its debatable whether the indictment would even hold up if it went to court. If he were indicted with any kind of violent or dishonesty crime, obviously he should step down. But the current indictment is based on an interpretation of their business practices, which they were not hiding. They knew the risks of trading within the US, and taking them is what propelled them to a solid #2 market share. Pokerstars has put them to shame when it comes to paying back players and not mixing player funds with operating funds, but that also just goes to show how much more money PokerStars has. The reason that they don&#039;t communicate with players is that their situation is dire; if they tell the truth, they would spook players into withdrawing, which would put them in an even worse position. If they lie and say everything is ok, then they lose all credibility when it comes out that things were not ok. So they remain quiet, and desperately try to put their house in order before they lose all their players.</description>

			<description>Considering all of the problems and mismanagement that appear to be occuring at FTP, i&#039;m kinda shocked that Ray Bitar hasn&#039;t been replaced or removed as its CEO. Typically when a CEO is &quot;indicted&quot; they would be replaced by the board of directors, or they would voluntarily step aside in the interim &quot;for the good of the company&quot;, not so in this case. No communications...no &#039;reasonable&#039; messages...on the part of FTP. Every day that goes by without either results in a further loss of confidence and &#039;value&#039; in the company as a whole. Can they really be that inept that they don&#039;t understand this?</description>

			<description>Interesting. If Binion owns a significant share of FT, would that make FT eligible for license under Barton&#039;s bill, should the slim chance that it pass actaully happen? Does he qaulify for the running a 500 game casino for the past 5 years requirement in the bill?</description>
