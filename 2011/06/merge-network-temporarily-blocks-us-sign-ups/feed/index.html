			<description>DC has legalized government-run online poker. I haven&#039;t read their bill, but I assume that such a bill would ban unlicensed online poker. It is strange that Merge didn&#039;t ban WA state residents.</description>

			<description>Nofx fan: I&#039;m a bit confused. Isn&#039;t WA state the one state (I think, not sure if they are the only one) that has unequivocally banned online poker? Yet Merge was allowing signups from there and not DC, where the virtually the opposite had happened legislatively? I&#039;m confused.</description>

			<description>I&#039;d like to add that there seems to be some confusion coming from either Merge or on the part of some of it&#039;s skins. Washington D.C. was one of the 4 states they stopped allowing new sign up&#039;s from, however, they seem to have mistakenly applied this to Washington State in some cases. After further follow up with one of their skins, the skin&#039;s owner got in contact with Merge (I think, that&#039;s what was purposed anyway) and a WA state player was able to create an account, even though WA state was not listed from the drop-down menu of states you have to choose from when opening an account. Also note this had to be done manually by the skin, although it looks like they have changed it since and added WA state to that drop-down tab again.</description>
