			<description>The one who truly deserves the blame is YOU. It&#039;s been well known for damn near 2 years that UB/AP were shady. You took the risk playing on a scummy site and now you&#039;re paying the price. Next time don&#039;t give your money to scum if you want it back.</description>

			<description>ok is not Obamas fault but is the feking USA government fault the same way. gready feking bastards, if you think AB/UB or FTP are crooks take a look at USA. Im from Sweden and been playing on UB for years and they now owe me $38k.I understand I should blame UB but if US wasnt crooks this would never had happened. Tax money on already taxed money, close down .com domains, freeze non US player accounts, who the hell do US think they are? what´s going to happen next? are you going to Libya and fake a war and steel oil? Naaaa.....US &quot;land of the free&quot; would never do that!?!?!?</description>

			<description>&quot;It does not include money that was frozen when some of Cereus’s bank accounts were seized by the United States Department of Justice on April 15th.&quot; So, it might be possible that AP/UB will have enuf money if they can get their hands on it? Really really sux, tho...took 2 yrs to build a decent online bankroll and now i&#039;m running terrible offline and now i can&#039;t even augment my offline bankroll with my online winnings, can&#039;t play cheap tnmts, can&#039;t get a variety of games to play, etc. f&#039;g congress needs to get this legalized and regulated and stop letting DOJ/law enforcement shake down poker sites for new police cars...........</description>

			<description>LOL, sure blame Obama for it, afterall, he was president in 2006 when the bill to kill online gambling in the US was passed...right? Blame the law not the enforcement of it! If you don&#039;t like the law, get educated on the facts, and then work to repeal it.</description>
