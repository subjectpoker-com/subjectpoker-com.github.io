			<description>Reading the press release (this wording was taken directly from there) at http://www.gamblingcontrol.org/userfiles/file/Website%20Statement%20-%20FTP%20suspension%20290611.pdf we see that they must indeed cease to process withdrawals. This is somewhat understandable. For example, if FTP does not have enough funds to cover all deposits, it would be unfair to process all EU withdrawals while not processing any US withdrawals.</description>

			<description>&quot;The Suspension Notice means that FTP must cease to: Register new customers. Accept deposits from existing customers. Allow existing customers to withdraw funds that are held in their accounts. Permit customers to participate in any form of poker game play or gambling transaction.&quot; The way you worded this makes the third statement confusing and worrying. Does it mean FTP must cease to allow existing customers to withdraw funds that are held in their accounts, or just allow existing customers to withdraw funds that are held in their accounts?</description>

			<description>At least they went from &quot;scheduled maintenance in progress&quot; which was an outright lie, to &quot;maintenance in progress&quot;. I&#039;m not quite sure if that is progress though :(</description>

			<description>doesnt it look like the AGCC wants to save its reputation cuz they might know more / expect ftp to bust and act now. shouldnt they have been the institution to observe and regulate ftp _beforehand_ to avoid something like what happened and they failed or is it more likely they have been deceived by ftp? what is the licence &#039;worth&#039; actually? ftp is not allowed to offer its services from those island but y not move somewhere else?</description>
