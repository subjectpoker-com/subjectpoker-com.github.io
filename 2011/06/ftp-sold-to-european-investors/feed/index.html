			<description>Hi Bhan, We agree. It was a mistake to report on someone else&#039;s story with no independent confirmation. We&#039;d avoided doing so in the past, but this story was so big and the LA Times is so reputable, that we decided to publish it. Of course, it turned out to be quite a misleading article, and we learned our lesson. We appreciate you pointing it out. This won&#039;t be the last time that we screw up, and we&#039;re happy to be held accountable.</description>

			<description>bhan, you have to remember that many readers will not have seen the LAT article, which is quite significant because the sources for that article appear to have been FTP&#039;s own lawyers. SP doesn&#039;t flood us with stories, so if one or two stories end up being irrelevant in hindsight, I think that&#039;s OK, it&#039;s only been a few stories a week, it&#039;s not as if they are flooding us with a dozen stories a day (plus I do think that this story is pretty big, even if unverified/unknown, it was all anybody was talking about last night and today).</description>

			<description>But it does bring to light the LA Times article, which I would not have known about otherwise.</description>

			<description>I have been fascinated by Subject Poker ever since I&#039;ve come across the site. I admire the site&#039;s founding philosophy and wholeheartedly appreciate its original, fresh, and objective reporting. But a post like this, that says nothing new and original about the issue, whose only additional content starts with &quot;unable to confirm&quot; and &quot;it is unknown&quot; makes me wonder if I want to come back to the site. I&#039;m sure it took a lot of effort even to make these statements about what&#039;s unconfirmed and what&#039;s unknown, and that&#039;s truly praiseworthy. But a reader would rather appreciate statements about what&#039;s confirmed and what&#039;s known. After all, anything that has not been reported as confirmed or known is probably unconfirmed or unknown. Thank you Subject Poker for all the hard work!!! :)</description>
