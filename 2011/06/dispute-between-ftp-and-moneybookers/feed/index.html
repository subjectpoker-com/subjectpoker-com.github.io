			<description>It should be totally obvious to everyone now that FTP doesn&#039;t have any money, even enough to pay the offshore players. If they dont close this deal this month, it&#039;s sayonara. My guess is they are paying the employees out of pocket (or with whats left) hoping to get a deal done, because if they dont get it done, they are SOL personally with that class action suit hanging out there. Heck, its common sense and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they didn&#039;t even make the final payroll payment at the end of the month if this deal doesn&#039;t get done</description>

			<description>@CuriousFive: Actually, you can have multiple MB accounts (USD and non-USD) to avoid those exchange rates. MB allows it.</description>

			<description>@Brian: Great article. However very curious why FTP (or any site) would compensate more for payouts than deposits. Quite clearly it is of a greater (only) concern to them that they can get the money not to give it back. So do we have numbers on the respective compensations for MB? Or maybe this is not so much about the pure compensation for MB but also about the huge extra profit MB makes from withdrawals by giving horrible exchange rates to their users. Withdrawing USD into an non USD MB account costs you as a player a lot due to the horrible exchange rate. MB and FTP: The pot calling the kettle black?</description>

			<description>FullTilt Poker looks very unethical site.Once to their European Customers which are still unable to cashout their money 2months and 2nd time because US players were played on credit for about 60Mln USD.I strongly advice to everyone to not play and to not doing any bussiness with this company.</description>

			<description>If this is true, then why hasn&#039;t any action been taken against both FT and MB? Players who are unaware of this will still continue to get cheated. Lauren </description>

			<description>Too little, far too late from Moneybookers. They have been aware for some time now that Full Tilt have not been paying players. Moneybookers have chosen to take the processing fees and happily send their customers&#039; money to Full Tilt, knowing that it&#039;s going into a black hole. I&#039;ll never trust Moneybookers again. They&#039;ve acted disgracefully and at the time of writing, you can still deposit at FT with MB.</description>

			<description>Great article Brian and nicely written. I was just referred over here by a close friend. What bothers me about all of this is the fact Full Tilt Poker refuses to keep in constant contact with its players and affiliates who have been loyal to them for years. When a company such as Full Tilt Poker can not or unwilling to process withdraws of a particular ewallet they should also stop the depositing feature of that ewallet as well. I for one have been waiting around 25 days and this is unacceptable especially when I am both a player and affiliate. My players and business are being affected by this and it makes me look bad as well since I have referred several players there. ON the flip side I feel like MoneyBookers has done a poor job at protecting its clients in this matter and the deposit feature should of been turned off long ago - at least until this issue could be resolved. Lets put it this way - Moneybookers can see there is an issue here yet they are doing nothing about it except to make threats of closing off business ties. An immediate stop of deposits should of happened a long time ago. This has tarnished an almost flawless reputation with MoneyBookers. I lost allot of respect them in this case.</description>
