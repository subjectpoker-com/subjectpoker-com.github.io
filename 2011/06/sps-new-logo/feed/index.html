			<description>I have to be a bit honest... I think the new logo is slightly weak. while it may work well for a header(and it does that well). I think when you begin to think in terms of a long time line as a representation of your new company, it falls far short. Have you guys tried this logo in color as your header? http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2723/5831094905_bf35d6f8e3_b.jpg I am not criticizing drew, just this incantation of a logo on it&#039;s own merits. I&#039;d love the opportunity to make some additional designs for you guys if you ever make the transition to marketing items such as hats and shirts... etc. it&#039;s never to early to start thinking about marketing.</description>

			<description>Yea, I really like this logo and think it represents the site and its purposed content well. Well done Drew! Also, thank YOU SP and wish you guys the best. We desperately need a poker news site that&#039;s not biased by business relationships such as the affiliate bus. Well that and the people behind it are obv cool. I&#039;d really like to see more from Scot Bell as I think he&#039;s a fantastic writer and I really like his style. As much and as well as he&#039;s done with the UB/AP scandal&#039;s, it&#039;d be cool if he could branch out into some other stories for SP.</description>
