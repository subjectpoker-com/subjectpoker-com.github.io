			<description>Poverty? So they are now bitching about poverty because the Poker Sites at the IGA have cut off funding? Don&#039;t they have 1.2 million members? I&#039;m a little upset that this man is has email addresses phone numbers and addresses of 1.2 million &quot;members&quot; and doesn&#039;t mention once in his interview that he is going to structure a NRA type membership system to insure funding in the future. Woulda Coulda Shoulda about the Success or lack there off the the PPA&#039;s efforts. It&#039;s all bout the future and what you are doing TODAY for Poker in America. If all this &quot;executive director&quot; can do is give you a bunch of &quot;you knows&quot; maybe they need a better man for that tittle.</description>
