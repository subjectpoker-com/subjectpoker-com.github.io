			<description>Thanks for your reply, TwoBits. Thanks kind of the way I see it. Still, no offense, I wish a major poker related website (and/or a few lawyers) would write about this issue -- one which has caused me considerable concern for nearly eight months.</description>

			<description>I love this site...I play PLAYMONEY and have found a vast amount of free guidance and opportunity for free councelling by the worlds premier poker players. I aspire to become a well educated, informed, experienced poker player. FTP gave me all those opportunities FOR FREE. I was enjoying the free play..benefiting from the experiences and would like to see FTP&#039;s free site return. Can I get an AMEN?</description>

			<description>My advice - tell your bank not to honor any debits that FTP tries to make. (They&#039;re prohibited from doing so anyway, so you probably don&#039;t even need to.) Or you could just close the account, if it makes you feel better. Nothing wrong with that. Leglly, you&#039;ve got every reason to believe that you didn&#039;t get what you paid for. You were paying for the service of on-line poker, which includes the ability to withdraw any winnings you might have made. In actuality, you didn&#039;t have that ability. Thus, FTP didn&#039;t provide you the services that you paid for, they&#039;re in breach of contract (written or not), and this discharges any remaining duty you might have had under the contract. Basically, everyone was playing with play money as of the moment FTP became unable to honor withdrawals, and in paying real money you were victimized. Even if your situation were different in that you lost the money and were actually charged, an attorney could make the argument there that FTP should have to pay you back, again because it didn&#039;t provide the services that it sold to you. As for the DOJ&#039;s ability to attach the funds in your account based on the judgment against FTP, no worries there either. You&#039;re certainly not an accomplice or conspirator with regards to the wire-fraud charge because you didn&#039;t know FTP was committing wire fraud. Afaik, that&#039;s all FTP&#039;s been charged with. And if the DOJ ever tries FTP for a criminal violation of the 2006 law itself and tries to get at consumers&#039; funds through the allegation that they participated knowingly in illegal activity, it would fall pretty flat. It&#039;s an easy argument to make that the 2006 law is void on its face for vagueness because it fails to define the term &quot;gambling&quot;, which it seeks to criminalize. There&#039;d be huge problems there also with conolidating the cases and/or proving the necessary mens rea of every single defendant the DOJ could indict. They&#039;re really, really unlikely to go there. TLDR - you&#039;re probably safe, but to be certain just tell your bank what&#039;s going on.</description>

			<description>Throughout the past many months I have asked this question both of numerous people and on several websites. I continue to be confused. Please allow me to inquire here. I seem to be one of those Full Tilt depositors to which this article refers. Between November 2010 and March 2011, I made a number (nearly twenty) of “Quick Deposits” totaling several thousands of dollars. To date none have been processed through my bank. As the “Black Friday” story unfolded I began to understand why. Yet I continue to wonder what, if anything, I should do about these unprocessed deposits. It has been suggested that those in my position leave the funds in the bank account and take a ‘wait and see’ approach. Others suggest closing the account and ‘forget about it.’ Neither of these approaches seem to resolve my daily consternation -- and both raise questions. My questions are, I suppose, both legal and moral in nature. Were these deposits (and/or the processing thereof) illegal? If yes, could any future “deal” with the Department of Justice reverse the previous “illegality”? If so, how? Morally (as I see it), in good faith I made these deposits. I “lost” the money. Someone “won” it. Where, if anywhere, does the “moral” issue factor into the “legal” one? Is there a statute of limitations regarding (these) banking transactions? If a deal is made between Full Tilt and the DoJ (which I suspect there will be) will this deal include allowing FT to process these deposits -- or just allow FT to return funds? If the former must (should) I maintain the funds in my bank account ad infinitum? Perhaps understandably the vast majority of online posts I read discuss the concerns of those to whom FT “owes” money. Very few are from those in my situation. While I realize there are, as yet, no definitive answers I would very much appreciate some educated opinions and “best guesses.” Thanks.</description>

			<description>The world desperately needs more fact-checked journalism; the Internet has all but killed the newspaper, which was the last journalistic medium that demanded some kind of factual rigor. The demand for instantaneous updates, scooping your competitors by three minutes, etc., has destroyed much of the fact-checking we used to take for granted in our news. &quot;Subject: Poker&quot; is a breath of fresh air on this front and I&#039;m heartened to see Noah and Thomas sticking to their guns on the integrity vs. speed issue. Keep the citations coming (footnote, side-note, whatever). Check and double-check your sources. We can all wait another day (or another week) to get the story if we can then read that story and say, &quot;Here is the truth as it is best understood.&quot; Regards, Lee</description>
