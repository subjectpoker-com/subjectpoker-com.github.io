			<description>Dan&#039;s a good guy, and a poker genius, so I don&#039;t think he deserves too much heat. He made some semi-shady deals with Haseeb and Girah, and every thing that could have possibly gone wrong went wrong, causing it all to blow up in his face. He should have either denied any interviews or been completely 100% straight up from the beginning, and not told all the little lies. I hope Dan continues crushing, and Haseeb finds happiness walking the earth, or whatever he plans to do.</description>

			<description>Perhaps it´s a little early to pass judgement on Cates. It´s clear he did make several mistakes so I´m not saying he is without fault, but it´s even more clearl he has really bad social skills which invevitably affect how we perceive what he is actually trying to say. I do beleive he is hidding things, but there´s the chance that it´s not for the reasons we think.</description>

			<description>I take issue with this comment. I think you mean completely biased, but I believe your typo was subconsciously correct. Perhaps the day 1 interview was more measured and respectful, but there again, Cates does turn round a day later and admit to lying to them. Top notch work by NH and VS, and I&#039;m also gonna do a &#039;dway&#039; and show my appreciation via paypal.</description>

			<description>This guy is a cheat. Multi-accounting is against the TOS of all major sites. He has no clear ethical standards. Any person implicated in any such scandal should be banned forever from playing online. Any online poker site that wishes to have any sort of credibility would do well to fully investigate and ban these players. He may have won millions but if he has no qualms about cheating people in one instance, how can anyone believe for certain that his past winnings have been won legitimately. I am disgusted by people like this. Great work on the interview guys. Thanks.</description>

			<description>Jungleman makes himself look so foolish in both of these interviews, and it seems completely obvious that hes lying in both. When someone asks you a simple question and you say &quot;let me think&quot; that to me means that he is thinking of how he really wants to answer vs what the truth really is, because if someone really couldnt remember or had to really stop and think about so many things in their own very recent past, than that person is in no way smart enough to play poker at levels that Jungleman does. even in the second interview he is OBVIOUSLY still not being completely truthful. all this makes you wonder about all the millions he made and what other kind of shady shit he and Jose and Hassib were doing.</description>

			<description>I love NoahSD&#039;s blogs, he&#039;s given a lot of useful info freely that took him a lot of work to get. With all the love I have for him, he comes across horrible in these interviews. He seems completely unbiased and attacks Cates constantly. is there some backstory to explain that?</description>

			<description>Also, not once in all those interviews did I hear Cates apologize for any of this. I didn&#039;t hear any sense of remorse, only disappointment because this became public and hurt his reputation. He was specifically questioned about using another account, and (if I recall correctly) if he felt bad about it, and he said he lost $20,000 so he why should he feel bad about it. He expresses outrage, dropping F bombs, that people would accuse him of certain things, but he can&#039;t grasp why anyone would be outraged with his behavior. In his mind he has justified all of this and doesn&#039;t feel bad about it. He doesn&#039;t get it. He doesn&#039;t understand what he has become.</description>

			<description>Cates look bad because he cheated and lied about it, not because he didn&#039;t keep close tabs on Jose. He multiaccounted and deceived other people. He tried to cover it up. He did interview #1 and denied/lied about many things. He played on Jose&#039;s account. He did a lot more and lied about it. He came clean on it. I wouldn&#039;t put money on the fact that he came clean on everything. What he did was 100% wrong. Qureshi looks like bigger scum. The guy is a total scam artist with zero credibility. Where the f*** is Jose? Is there any evidence that he exists? Thanks for investigating this and bringing it to light.</description>
