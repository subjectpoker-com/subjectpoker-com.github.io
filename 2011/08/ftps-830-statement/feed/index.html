			<description>I had the same issue with the check button and raised it with FTP. They didn&#039;t respond to me at all. After a while, it just seemed obvious that you either had to move your mouse every time or they were going to catch you in their little &quot;oops&quot; trick to get extra rake. Such BS and an easy fix. That was a factor in my leaving FTP. Plus, PS just had more options and rewards to its players... and convenient buttons. I miss PS...and hey, they paid back all their players.</description>

			<description>What is truly insane is that they would deliberately not pay their licensing fees so that the site goes entirely offline and they lose their remaining 50% of their business and cash flow. How can they be so f&#039;g stupid!!! The best user interface around (imo) going to zero in value. So truly sad..........</description>

			<description>Yep Doc, It&#039;s all about the drop. PokerStars has it&#039;s profit generators too- (the sit n go rake increases if you choose not to play turbo format, for example.) however, they did return substancial amounts of profit back to the player with all the freerolls and promotionals. Their quick and apologetic return of seized money previously, (Washington State) speaks VOLUMES about their ethical business approach. I am ashamed of the way my(?) government assaulted THEM- yet rewarded the criminal banking sector for outright fraud! Geezus....... makes ya wonder....... Who is gonna invade America and restore freedom and democracy!? Power In Numbers, folks- We ALL need to get together and reset this mess- and brother, we need to do it quick!</description>

			<description>PS I was with FTP for several years since even BEFORE they went live when we tested the software with only play money. I only left because I really felt unappreciated compared to the freebies at PS as well as being ignored any time I had an issue. To get very specific, I also hated that they did what I thought was purposely an interface issue that would generate more rake. The Check checkbox would change to Call button in EXACTLY the same location on the screen and I would sometimes mean to Check but instead Call a big bet when I actually now wanted to fold. I brought this issue up many times over the years and was completely ignored. I even tried asking some of the Pros who were actively involved in the programming for the site in live chat and was basically told tough shit and shut up about it. It all added up to them losing a customer who was playing for hours every day.</description>

			<description>If what they are saying is true, FTP was run by idiots who never bothered to balance or audit their books. Also, why didn&#039;t we hear about over $100 million in earlier bank seizures? If I had heard about that, I would&#039;ve cashed out immediately. Now they are saying they hope someone will buy FTP and then refund everyone&#039;s bankrolls, are they high? Say someone has that kind of money and wants to start a poker site, they would never buy FTP because: 1. Why should they start a poker site that deep in the hole? Just start a new site. 2. FTP reputation is such crap right now I wouldn&#039;t take it for free. So don&#039;t hold your breath. I also believe that the famous names who were being paid by FTP (and I would bet got all their cash back already) should personally reimburse the public poker players that they have helped rob. We generated SO much money for them over the years that is the least they can do. I moved to PS years ago because the freerolls and such for frequent players were a LOT better (several totaling over $250K vs ONE at $30K per month) there, but never closed out my FTP account, since I had tournament tickets. Those were converted to cash in the account but I never had a chance to cash it out.</description>

			<description>Hey Noah, The statement says the amount is frozen/seized from US banks, and you clarify that it&#039;s ALL the money frozen/seized &#039;belonging to Full Tilt Poker that was frozen in the two year period up to and including April 15th&#039;, is this including Non-US banks?</description>

			<description>I didn&#039;t lose much $ from this, but I especially miss the opportunity to continue practicing and learning the game at a great site. Damn, I miss Rush Poker. BTW, Republican candidate Ron Paul supports the legalization of online poker...</description>
