			<description>Master Bates - you&#039;re ridiculous. Lack of author replies doesn&#039;t define &quot;legit&quot;. If the writer stays professional always, then fine. If this site gets significantly bigger you may just get your wish... for now it&#039;s a personal touch that leaves some visitors feeling more connected. So don&#039;t be an ass... you&#039;re not paying, so don&#039;t act like you&#039;re being cheapened, and feel free to move on post-article if you don&#039;t like the responses.</description>

			<description>dj bates, I admire you. I admire your ability to make the most sophisticated and intelligent conclusion after discussing an issue factually. You discussed back and forth, got thoughts on your views, carefully thought them through, and came up with the most intelligent, wize, grown-up, and factual conclusion that could possibly be made in this situation: they are all dorks. I admire such a man of deep conviction, such broad wizdom, and such groundbreaking intelligence. Please run for president.</description>

			<description>We don&#039;t comment to make the site look bigger than it is. We do not post under nicknames, nor do our friends. The comments are genuine comments, and Noah&#039;s responses are useful for those readers who have questions after reading the article. If Noah has enough time to do that, why would he not spend those few minutes to inform users on our informative site?</description>

			<description>As long as it&#039;s understood that most of the comments are from homemade, I guess you&#039;d call it that, names that are mostly staff guys trying to stir up conversation I guess it is fine. I just thought journalism was about honesty and integrity, so it is understandable that when poker players get involved a lot of that may be left out. I am not saying that writer dude is dishonest because at least it is his actual name on his posts. It just makes no sense to have staff guys and friends comment to try to make the site look bigger than it really is, only to have the editor comment like he is a lowly high school writer defending his high school newspaper.</description>

			<description>You don&#039;t see &quot;legit sites&quot; answering in the comments section because those sites are heavily trafficked and commented upon. With a niche news site that gets maybe a dozen comments, what harm does it do to answer questions that readers have?</description>

			<description>I certainly didn&#039;t see anyone address you with a question while reading the comments. It just sounds as if u r defending yourself in this and other articles, therefore it makes the website look amateurish and like you must justify yourself instead for what you&#039;ve done. Write another article if you feel the need to reveal more information.</description>

			<description>I don&#039;t see anything wrong with responding to reader comments. I think readers appreciate it. In the comments to this article, I posted twice, both times responding to a question that was asked of me... Can you explain why you think we shouldn&#039;t be responding to comments?</description>
