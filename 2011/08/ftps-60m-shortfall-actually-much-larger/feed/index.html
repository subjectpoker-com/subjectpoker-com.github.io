			<description>you are an idiot. the 128 million was not paid because it was never charged to our bank accounts. when they did get a processor to take the payments they got shut down and legally they cannot take the money. deadbeats, i mean come on are you serious. i have a lot of money that never got credited to my bank account and i actually emailed full tilt and told them to take my money because i dont like owing money. they responded saying they are working on a solution. i can see being upset at full tilt but to call people deadbeats for doing nothing except not having funds withdrawn is pretty ignorant</description>

			<description>Phil Ivey should be arrested also!!! He knew the money he was stealing was players money. In between flying around on private jets with players money he forgot to pay taxes on most of his Full Tilt money! It&#039;s called tax evasion people. David Grey who has 30 million of players money. Notice how the full tilt OWNERS oh (share holders) now are in hiding!!! HMMMMMM You will see very soon the unfolding of the full tilt thieves. Most of them are hiding out of the country.</description>

			<description>They are not saying they have $9 million in cash. They are saying that they can reduce the $128 million owed to players to $119 million by subtracting the $9 million that still sits in players accounts that deposited and never had their banks debited. The rest of the money went to other players or lost to rake.</description>
