			<description>I&#039;m not too shocked at the sentence-nailing him down is like trying to herd rattlesnakes. I would not be too shocked if they let him off just so they can watch him when he gets out, so they can follow him to the money. I&#039;ve known him for about 12 years; he&#039;s ALWAYS got an exit strategy. The story isn&#039;t over yet, unless someone he hurt on the other side of the law gets to him. And I wouldn&#039;t bet on him being somebody&#039;s &quot;wife&quot; in prison; he is the quintessential survivor, an endless wheeler-dealer.</description>

			<description>I know of this Guy and he is scum. he ripped a lot of people off even in his small community..he wasn&#039;t liked by even villians. I can&#039;t believe he will only serve 2 years which is crazy. I know people who served double his time and did much much less</description>

			<description>Excellent coverage of this situation! I knew Mr. Rubin closely before he went down this path, and he is a fascinating individual. He could be one of the nicest guys you ever met, or, if you were in the way of his plans, an amazing manipulator. In spite of ALL of the evidence, don&#039;t be surprised if he sees freedom again. He is a survivor.</description>

			<description>No, she had a lot of issues, most tied to the neglect of her diabetes. She would actually cause herself to go into a diabetic shock as a manipulation tool, when things weren&#039;t going her way. She was no saint, believe me.</description>

			<description>A &quot;Colorful Cast of Characters&quot; to be sure. Sounds more like a screenplay than real life.... I can see it now, John Goodman as Ira, Will Smith (who else?) as Phil Ivey, and a cast of thousands.... A really fascinating read, keep it up! Looking forward to Part II. Any schedule for the sequel&#039;s release? By the way, just curious if any of S:P contributors/founders have legal or journalism backgrounds?</description>

			<description>Very interesting, lots of detail, I feel like I just finished a semester of law school. The intro does make it sound like you have an actual interview with Ira Rubin, using phrases like &quot;asked the question&quot; and &quot;What&#039;s it like to be on the run from the law for years?&quot; So you might want to make it clear that this is actually about his criminal history and not an interview. I would also add the year 2011 after April in the third last paragraph about his arrest, it kind of reads like he was arrested in April of 2007, a little confusing. I am also curious if there was any chance that his ex-wife&#039;s death was not of natural causes. This story goes to show you how to handle being charged with a crime. Hire lawyers and deny, deny, deny as long as you can. If you are as guilty as this guy, eventually it will catch up with you, but at least he had 8 years of fun before ending up as someone&#039;s wife in prison. I am also interested why poker sites would work with this guy, he obviously can&#039;t be trusted. Do you have to work with heartless scammers to process poker payments? Is that the price to pay for operating a poker site in the US?</description>

			<description>Thanks for the kind words guys, and thanks for reading an extra long article, and that just covered the last few years in his 20+yr history. It&#039;s been an interesting journey learning the ins and outs of how these things worked from behind the scene. These are the guys that handled your money, and it&#039;s really a much smaller community than people realized. More to come soon on this subject!</description>
