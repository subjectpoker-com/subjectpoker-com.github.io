			<description>You seem to have burst out of nowhere to instantly become one of the major poker news sites. You have footnotes(!). But it&#039;s when I read &quot;Thomas and Noah founded Subject: Poker because of general dissatisfaction with the established poker media&quot; that I knew for sure that you&#039;re going to get my &quot;best new poker website&quot; or &quot;best poker news site&quot; award.</description>

			<description>I&#039;ve often felt that poker needed the equivalent of &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; or &quot;Undercurrent&quot; (a no-advertising newsletter for the scuba diving industry). This is by far the best contender I&#039;ve seen so far. I wish you great success. Regards, Lee Jones</description>
