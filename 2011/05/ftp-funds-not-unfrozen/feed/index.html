			<description>So when can we expect to be reading your admission of making a mistake by attacking something we have every legal right to do in our own homes with our own money? And with said when will you realize when you do something like this , you appear to be the real criminals. Furthermore you will never have regained my trust DoJ, what you have accomplished with your actions, is such to make the American public a victim. That&#039;s right you have victimized us, no matter how carefully you address this situation. Why don&#039;t you go after the stock market THAT IS GAMBLING 100%, Why not actually do something good for the people instead of money grabbing like thugs? Your actions are an affront to my senses and appalling to even those that do not play poker. SHAME SHAME WE KNOW YOUR NAME!</description>

			<description>Damn Straight. No funds should be released whatsoever to these guys. They have not made good on payments due to all USA players and nothing shows they are going to even if the DOJ released the funds. Let em die or live on what they have now. They made millions of $$ over the years and have more than enough to cover USA deposist if they have not over extended themselves like I believed that they have. I think they spent more than they made on ads and such on the belief the money would never end. I think funds were comingled and abused in terms of good business sense. As such, no other entity will invest in them for a paltry $150 Million or so for a great business raking millions a day. Wonder why not. Either pay up or fold like you should Full Tilt. This is coming from a player that is owed money from FTP. I&#039;m just stating what I believe to be true IMO. GL all players.</description>
