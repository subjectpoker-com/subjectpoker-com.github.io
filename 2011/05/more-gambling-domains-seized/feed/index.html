			<description>Considering the UIGEA regulations only went into effect in mid 2010 the US government IS moving at lightning speed. The speed of an investigation is purely dependent on the ultimate goal of the investigating body. The two rounds of indictments and the targets of the investigations shows us their ultimate resolution. SDNY specifically warned off Maryland from its investigation and sting operation which is why nobody will be arrested. The DOJ is operating under a specific set of instructions only AG Holder and Pareet(sp) understand. My guess is the Reid Bill and the eventual legalization of online poker forced them to conclude and unseal the indictments. In over 20 years of LE investigations I have never seen the Feds move so fast.</description>

			<description>&quot;Sweet. Instead of worrying about pedophiles, rapists, burglars, and murderers.. the government is worried about how grown adults spend their money on poker website. How about working with these poker websites &amp; taxing them instead of taking them down, costing these poker players all of their money?&quot; AMEN Lost complete faith in this country which is a shame because I was once a real patriot. Very strongly considering just leaving and never looking back.</description>

			<description>Rob C, What kind of sky falling BS are you trying to spout. You do know that Wa DC was the first state to recently legalize online poker right? And Nevada is pushing very hard right now to get it legalized as well with casino corps pouring in millions to lobby it. Additionally, there have been tons of back and forth talks with Cali doing interstate only online poker. Also, lightning speed? Yes, half a decade since UIGEA went into affect definitely &#039;lightning speed&#039; LOL at your perspective. WTFrUtalkingAbout</description>

			<description>&quot;Curiously, this alternative domain bmaker.ag was registered on 18 May 2011, a mere 5 days before the indictments and the seizures ... Did Bookmaker.com see this coming?&quot; Makes you wonder about the timing of Doyle dissociating himself with Doyle&#039;s Room as well.</description>

			<description>While I am not happy with this round of indictments be ready for the piling on to begin. With supposedly billions of gambling money floating around any state with half a standing will be joining in. After the owners are identified there will be a whole new round of tax evasion and civil suits to finish off what is left of the US online gaming industry. FYI, From experience I can tell you that the US DOJ is moving at lightning speed since the final UIGEA regulations went into effect.</description>
