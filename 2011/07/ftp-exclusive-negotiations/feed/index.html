			<description>@NoahSD: 3 week period started on Thursday June30. So it would end tomorrow on Wednesday July20, right? Also the Alderney meeting on July26 is now a &quot;public hearing&quot; which IMHO rules it out to be a proper hearing. It would seem likely to be rather a presentation of why FTP gets their licence back or not. (just my opinion) So it pretty much is now or never for the next 7 days I guess?</description>

			<description>Noah ,
				Thanks for publishing this clarification. This makes a lot of sense as a lot of investors who are going to commit $100s of thousands in DD want exclusivity - still I cant imagine what these guys are thinking. The closure of the site was the real nail in the coffin. Every day its down, the value falls and if this story is true it could easily be another month before FTP has the money it needs to re-open. I can&#039;t see a deal of this magnitude being done in less then 1 month after DD is completed. It all seems a bit off the wall despite how confident the FTP people are...its looking more and more like a $300M commitment, which will include the real possibility now of losing a lot of the offshore players, significant restructuring costs (layoffs at Pocket Kings, etc..), payments to the DOJ and finally lots of promotions to keep players. The FTP brand was based on a lot of US players who unless they go offshore to live will not be &#039;publicly&#039; playing online for a while. Even if they make a deal with the DOJ, there are so many other things that can go wrong. What all of us really want to hear is what the DOJ deal is looking like - because clearly thats the real possible killer - not just from a money standpoint, but whether they insist the company cooperate against Bitar and company - I can&#039;t see them letting the company off that and not getting cooperation - and I can&#039;t see Bitar or the FTP gang agreeing to that issue. Wonder if that is part of the deal?</description>

			<description>&quot;The prospective investor was introduced to Full Tilt executives in mid May by Phil Ivey, a Team Full Tilt member and a partial owner of the poker site.&quot; 1, deal is done, pending approval of the payout to bitar and Nelson by Doj to be settled with doj, soley by Nelson and Bitar 2. doj negoiations are with Bitar, not with new controlling owner who holds in his name every shell co connected to FTP 3. Marco is correct, the investor Ivey introduced was Jack Binion, on behalf of Wynn International, under the guise &quot;Eu Investor&quot; so that it is not known publically 4. Ray was forced out 5. you know nothing, but what someone might want you to know, or not a reliable source.. Now, I expect you to kiss my ass when you see u are wrong, and I am right. thanks!</description>

			<description>It&#039;s very promising if the regulators and the DoJ are all involved in the negotiations. While of course it makes things much more complex (since there are more parties negotiating) it means it is likely that any deal will include a final settlement with the DoJ, Party Poker style, meaning FTP can open for business outside the US with a stamp of approval from Alderney and ARJEL and the players&#039; deposits can be released and repaid. This means that the amount they need to raise is &quot;only&quot; the amount needed to settle with the DoJ. It will still be a big number, but I bet it will be a lot less than a billion. It&#039;s really hard to think who the European investor might be. I could imagine Andy Beal cutting a deal like this but there aren&#039;t too many Andy Beals in Europe. Branson maybe, with a rebranding to Virgin Poker? Bernie Ecclestone likes to play though this is not really his style. Perhaps its Abramovitch or one of the other Russians.</description>

			<description>Personally, I think it is all supposition at this time, until something firm from either the FTP execs, and or Lawyers come out and say so, in an official capacity. I know if I was an exec of a company and was in negotiations with an outside company, and my Lawyers &quot;leaked&quot; information, I would sue them for breach of fiduciary duty, which they are bound by. Wording in the LA Times article, such as &quot;Attorneys associated with Full Tilt said the company......&quot; and &quot;Attorneys close to Full Tilt said....&quot; is, in my opinion, odd, as No names are mentioned, just &quot;Attorneys&quot; This is of course a moot point IF the FTP execs have given permission to &quot;leak&quot; information, which is not outside the realm of possibility, considering FTP execs lack of business skills. I mean, not even a short news release from Ray, Howard or any exec from FTP, saying something along the lines of &quot;Sorry for the delay, but we are working on a resolution, addressing our present situation, that will satisfy ALL of our players needs, in the near future.&quot; Vague, not saying anything specific, and non binding, in case nothing happens.</description>

			<description>I think if full tilt is sold, and there is enough to repay US players, that Full Tilt will have their bank account which suppoedsly were frozen would be unfrozen and there would be money to repay NON US players aswell. No one can say how the players would react if full tilt goes back online. I think I would be willing to give it a go if ftp is sold, cause the new owners knows that they can&#039;t take a month making a withdrawal as it has taken since BF, we for sure need to be reassured that Full Tilt has a good and healty cashflow in the future, otherwise they prob wont be able to recover. For me atleast I know if they come back online, I would prob make a withdrawal to see what the new status would be, if it takes more than a few days I would prob be done playing at tilt. If my withdrawals in approved wihtin a few days I would continue playing there. I would prob keep making small testwithdrawals making sure that they will keep up a hopefully more healthy cashflow.</description>

			<description>They&#039;ve been negotiating for longer than two weeks. I don&#039;t have a date for exactly when negotiations started (and that would likely depend on your definition of negotiations), but Full Tilt execs have been aware of these potential investors since at least mid May. The exclusivity agreement started almost two weeks ago. How negotiations are going is such an entirely subjective thing that we prefer not to report what we&#039;ve heard, especially when all of our sources have some bias in that regard. (We haven&#039;t heard much, anyway.) I think it&#039;s reasonable to assume that Full Tilt execs are optimistic since they agreed to exclusive bargaining. -Noah</description>
