			<description>This company is lying to people left and right. The last withdrawal I asked for from them was May 3rd. Typically once they confirm via email, I would always have the $ in my bank in 48 hours or Less. This time, no money. On the 16th I contacted them and they said the transfer was rejected and my funds were being returned to my quick tender acct. On May 18th, the funds indeed were there, with no way to withdraw them. Now this company has locked me out of logging into my account and tried to suddenly tell me my funds were seized on their way to My bank. This is untrue as, like I mentioned before, I saw them as being returned to my QT balance. They are giving me the run around, failing to communicate and still trying to insist my funds were seized. I will not stop with this until they pay me back my very large sum Of money that is rightfully mine.</description>

			<description>When will these websites acknowledge that the money they are &quot;witholding&quot; is simply not theirs. Tell me if I&#039;m wrong.</description>
