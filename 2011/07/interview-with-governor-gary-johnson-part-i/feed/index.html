			<description>&quot;GJ: Well, if I were to advocate such, I would never get elected because I think that’s just too much for people to bite off.&quot; LOL - he&#039;s got no chance anyway, might as well stand up for what he believes in. This was a good read. I like how you kept after him when he tried to dodge question.</description>

			<description>I would like to thank Gary Johnson for trying to help 10 million potential voters and wish him godspeed in the daunting task of familiarizing himself with the Barton bill. I do hope that Mr. Johnson himself will join the ranks of online poker players when able to do so. His astute mathematical acumen (e.g. reduce the military budget by 43% because national borrowing is 43%) would certainly make him a very popular addition to the player pool. I can say this with my hand on the holes where my heart once was (literally, of course.) Noah, Seriously, this is a quite splendid interview, with excellent, intelligent questions and follow-ups. Subject: Poker is the nuts.</description>

			<description>&quot;So, how much did I compromise being Governor of New Mexico? You could argue that I really didn’t compromise at all, that it was about doing what was right.&quot; &quot;Well, if I were to advocate such [legalizing cocaine], I would never get elected because I think that’s just too much for people to bite off.&quot; If you&#039;re going to go out there, don&#039;t flinch. It&#039;s not like you&#039;re going to lose anyone that would vote for you because you think cocaine should be legal.</description>

			<description>Noah, No problem and am sorry to shift the focus on something that wasn&#039;t a major focus on your work. But, I am a bit picky when it comes to financial accuracy! Keep up the good work you are doing! Scott</description>

			<description>Sorry to see you wasting space on this guy. He&#039;s polling less than 1% everywhere. It makes poker interests look clueless.</description>

			<description>Scott, First of all, please feel free to belabor any point. You&#039;re right. That wikipedia article is wrong, and it cites a source that also gets that wrong. Frankly, it&#039;s embarassing that I didn&#039;t stop to think about that. I&#039;ll correct the footnote now. Thanks for the correction. -Noah</description>

			<description>Noah, Not to belabor the point, but here is the complete Federal Reserve Act: http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htm Show me where in this Act that the Fed is prohibited from buying debt of the US to &#039;directly finance the government.&#039; In fact, as you will note in &#039;14 Open Market Operations&#039; the FED is specifically allowed to buy and sell obligations of the US government at will under the direction of the board of governors. This is a better example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation When the Fed buys bonds directly from the treasury, it then &#039;creates&#039; enough currency (whether electronic or not, it matters little) to pay for those bonds and deposits that with the treasury. The treasury then uses that money to pay its bills, or the bills of the federal government. So, I am not sure what is the basis of your comment that it is illegal for the Fed to do this. You might find this site useful - I use it a lot for American politics: http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-1452.html</description>

			<description>&quot;Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, has said that the U.S. is monetizing debt through QE, referencing the additional $600 billion created for QE2, &quot;For the next eight months, the nation’s central bank will be monetizing the federal debt.&quot; [72]&quot; Here is a direct quote from your Wikipedia citation.</description>

			<description>&quot;However, this money was not used to directly finance the deficit.&quot; - Not correct, you should check your facts. &quot;This money is not used to finance the government directly, but rather to buy assets from private companies and individuals in the hopes of preventing deflation and encouraging lending.&quot; - Also not correct. TARP did have programs to buy some assets from private sources, but these were all financial institutions in one form or another. The Fed &#039;creates&#039; money buy buying assets from banks (certainly not from private individuals) - the principal source of assets are US Treasury&#039;s which are direct obligations of the US government, although mortgage paper has also been purchased with a haircut. How this process works (buying bonds from banks) is through lending and bank deposits and there is a multiplier effect, which you can google if you so desire. But when they buy directly from the treasury, they are creating money (and hence financing the US government&#039;s deficit). Nevertheless, the Fed has been and remains an active participant in all auctions and as a direct purchaser of government bonds is financing the US government by creating money. I dont have exact figures, but absolutely QE2 led to the Fed monitizing the US deficit through direct purchases of US Bonds from the government (see http://goo.gl/5cOrx). The FED has created actual inflation in the economy for decades using this same process of artificially creating money annually, in a &#039;managed&#039; way, to the tune of about 3% per year, but it accelerated in the last two years due to measures taken to during the financial crisis. The Fed believes that QE2 has created &#039;excess&#039; reserves in the banking system that have not be lent (and this is true so far), and that the effects of QE2 have not created inflation, but helped ward off the potential for deflation. The Fed also believes that they can use the same process of selling bonds to unwind the effects of QE at any time and drain these reserves from the system.</description>
