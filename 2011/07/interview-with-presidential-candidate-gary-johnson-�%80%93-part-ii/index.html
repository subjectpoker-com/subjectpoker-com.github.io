He served in that role from 1995 to 2003, making him the first Governor of New Mexico to serve two full four-year terms after the term limit was increased from one to two in 1991. He is now running for President of the United States as a Republican. His political views are essentially libertarian, stressing small government. As Governor of New Mexico, he vetoed a record 750 bills.</p>
						<p>Much of the poker community learned about Governor Johnson when the Two Plus Two Poker Forums and the Poker Players Alliance began publicly supporting him in late June. Governor Johnson&#8217;s campaign started a <a title="&quot;Why Should Poker Players Get to Know Gary Johnson.&quot;" href="http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/29/news-views-gossip/why-should-poker-players-get-know-gary-johnson-1059486/" target="_blank">thread</a> on Two Plus Two and added a <a title="Gary Johnson 2012- Poker" href="http://www.garyjohnson2012.com/poker" target="_blank">poker section</a> to their website, and Governor Johnson attended Two Plus Two&#8217;s annual party in Las Vegas, and has publicly expressed his support for the right to play online poker. Two Plus Two has provided Governor Johnson with free advertising, stickied his <a title="&quot;Why Should Poker Players Get to Know Gary Johnson.&quot;" href="http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/29/news-views-gossip/why-should-poker-players-get-know-gary-johnson-1059486/" target="_blank">thread</a> in their extremely popular News, Views, and Gossip forum, publicly <a href="http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/showpost.php?p=27459989&amp;postcount=369" target="_blank">suggested</a> donating to the Johnson campaign, and (after this interview took place) publicly <a title="&quot;Do You Have a Website? Let's Help Spread the Word About Governor Gary Johnson&quot;" href="http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/29/news-views-gossip/do-you-have-website-lets-help-spread-word-about-governor-gary-johnson-1068993/" target="_blank">requested</a> that other websites support Governor Johnson as well. The Poker Players Alliance has featured Governor Johnson&#8217;s candidacy prominently on their <a title="PPA Website" href="http://theppa.org/" target="_blank">website</a> and PPA representatives have actively supported the Johnson campaign.</p>
						<p>I met up with Governor Johnson this past Thursday in a busy Starbucks in midtown Manhattan to talk with him about his campaign, how his campaign relates to poker in particular, and his political views in general. In the <a title="Interview with Presidential Candidate Gary Johnson – Part I" href="http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/07/interview-with-governor-gary-johnson-part-i/">first half</a> of the interview, Governor Johnson discussed his views on poker, the extent to which his stance on poker is a priority for him, his relationship with Two Plus Two Publishing, his general views on the role of the government, and his stance on drug policy. In this second half of the interview, Governor Johnson discusses a wide range of foreign policy issues, his chances of winning the presidency, the differences between himself and Congressman Ron Paul, and more.</p>

					<span id="Foreign_Policy"><h2>Foreign Policy</h2></span>
					<p><strong>Noah Stephens-Davidowitz: So, I&#8217;ve read a lot about your views on the size of the federal government and your views on domestic politics in general, but I’ve found almost no information at all about your views on foreign policy. Did you have any foreign policy experience as Governor of New Mexico?</strong></p>
					<p><strong></strong>Governor Gary Johnson: Nope. [There was a pause.] Other than Mexico, as a border state.</p>
					<p>For what that&#8217;s worth, I think that border violence has to do with drugs. Legalize marijuana, and I think that 75% of the border violence goes away because that&#8217;s the estimate of the Mexican drug cartels&#8217; activities that are engaged in the marijuana trade.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: But, as president, you&#8217;d have to interact with foreign countries all the time. You&#8217;d be our representative to the world, so I want to know more about your views. [Governor Johnson indicated that he agrees with this characterisation as I was speaking.] For example, what&#8217;s your policy on the <a title="Wikipedia- Israeli-Palestinian conflict" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli–Palestinian_conflict" target="_blank">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, having been to Israel&#8211;So, I&#8217;m opposed to foreign aid and the notion that we&#8217;re borrowing or printing money to the tune of 43 cents on every dollar and that we should be giving that away to other countries.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-1" id="fnref-1395-1">1</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>NSD: So you would cut aid to Israel, Pakistan,&#8230; [Governor Johnson interrupted.]</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> All. All aid.</p>
					<p>But, I think it&#8217;s important to distinguish between foreign aid and military alliances. Military alliances, I think being key to the notion of being able to reducing our military by 43% and still remain vigilant to the war on terror worldwide&#8211;other countries picking up that slack.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: So it sounds to me like you view military alliances as less a sort of benevolent interventionist tool and more as a sort of pragmatic tool.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Yeah. Yeah.</p>
					<p>[Governor Johnson was interrupted by a phone call.]</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: So, I suppose you&#8217;re still discussing fiscal issues, and I&#8217;m more interested in your more general views on foreign policy. I&#8217;m going to bring up the Israeli-Palestinian conflict again because that&#8217;s an issue where historically American leaders have tried to broker an agreement.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> So, I&#8217;ve been to Israel two times, and I&#8217;ve met with <a title="Wikipedia- Benjamin Netanyahu" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu" target="_blank">Netanyahu</a> two times. I&#8217;ve met with <a title="Wikipedia- Shimon Peres" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres" target="_blank">Peres</a>, I&#8217;ve met with <a title="Wikipedia- Ariel Sharon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon" target="_blank">Ariel Sharon</a>, and what I came away from those meetings with&#8211;and I was in Israel, and so I visited the <a title="Wikipedia- West Bank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank" target="_blank">West Bank</a>, I visited the <a title="Wikipedia- Golan Heights" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_heights" target="_blank">Golan Heights</a>&#8211;What I came away with, all of it, is that it&#8217;s a real mistake to think that we can broker something when it comes to Israel. they&#8217;re going to determine these issues to the best of their interests, and why should we pretend that that should be otherwise?</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: I think that Israel largely views our participation as helpful. You might argue that some of that is due to our aid, but we&#8217;ve almost always been at the table, and obviously you know that much of what progress has been made has been made with the help of the US.</strong><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-2" id="fnref-1395-2">2</a></sup><strong> So, if they asked you to, would you still not participate?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> By asked&#8211;Would I sit at the table? Absolutely. Sure.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: And what would you say at the table? Do you believe in a two-state solution, for example?</strong><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-3" id="fnref-1395-3">3</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, I think it&#8217;s a mistake the United States to even weigh in on that issue because Israel is going to determine that to the best&#8211;And, I could pretend to say something else. I could say otherwise, but I think that&#8217;s the mistake is that the United States should somehow believe that they&#8217;re going to act in the best interest of Israel as opposed to Israel themselves? [Governor Johnson was briefly inaudible.]</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Do you have a similar view on other conflicts where the US feels more threatened. For example, the conflict between North and South Korea and the <a title="Wikipedia- Six-party talks" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-party_talks" target="_blank">six-party talks</a> with North Korea&#8211;Do you similarly view the US&#8217;s role in those negotiations as too interventionist?</strong><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-4" id="fnref-1395-4">4</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, the whole notion of diplomacy&#8211;That&#8217;s a plus. I mean, we shouldn&#8217;t shy away from diplomacy ever when asked to participate, or even to weigh in. But to think that we&#8217;re the end&#8211;that whatever it is that we&#8217;re pressing is the end-all&#8211;I would just ask that the shoe be placed on the other foot, and think of any other country that&#8217;s going to tell us what we should or shouldn&#8217;t do. I just think it&#8217;s a mistake.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: But certainly you think we have interest in the world at large. What happens in other countries affects us greatly, in terms of our economics, our ability to travel, and our safety, but also in terms of our moral sensibilities.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Moral sensibilities? What would moral sensibilities be?</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: For example, do you think that the US should have intervened in <a title="Wikipedia- Kosovo War" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War" target="_blank">Kosovo</a>? There was a genocide there, and the United States intervened by way of NATO.</strong><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-5" id="fnref-1395-5">5</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, so our intervention there&#8211;At least my understanding is that the genocide still went on under the umbrella of a no-fly zone, that it still happened.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-6" id="fnref-1395-6">6</a></sup> So, I mean no. People point genocide as an example of &#8220;Do we want to stand by and watch genocide?&#8221; Well, no, we don&#8217;t.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Well, what alternative would you suggest?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, tell me of a situation where there has been genocide and we&#8217;ve stood by.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Sudan.</strong><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-7" id="fnref-1395-7">7</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Sudan?</p>
					<p>Isn&#8217;t it after the fact too that we really recognized it?</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: I would argue that it wasn&#8217;t particularly well publicized at the time, but it was known to people who spoke about it. It just didn&#8217;t get much coverage in the media.</strong><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-8" id="fnref-1395-8">8</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Yeah, so I would have loved to&#8211;Well first of all, i really loved being governor of New Mexico. I loved being there to receive the kinds of information needed to make decisions on these kinds of issues. I don&#8217;t know what was being made available to President of United States when you talk about Sudan. I don&#8217;t know what that is.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Suppose the president knew everything that was happening there as we know it now.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Then it assumes to me, we should have&#8230; [I interrupted.]</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: You would have intervened in Sudan?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Yes.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: And would you intervene now, for example, in <a title="Wikipedia- Somalia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia" target="_blank">Somalia</a>, where there&#8217;s anarchy and civil war?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, I don&#8217;t know what that information is. I really don&#8217;t.</p>
					<p>I&#8217;m against what&#8217;s happening in Libya.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-9" id="fnref-1395-9">9</a></sup> I&#8217;m against Iraq. I&#8217;m against Afghanistan, and I preface Afghanistan by saying initially I thought that was totally warranted. I thought we were successful in wiping out Al Qaeda, but that was ten years ago. Iraq&#8211;I&#8217;dve been opposed to that from that for very start, believing we had military capability to see them roll out any weapons of mass destruction. Libya? I&#8217;m opposed that. I&#8217;m opposed to everything we&#8217;re doing there. Don&#8217;t five other countries in the Middle East right now qualify for the same intervention? Where&#8217;s the end to this?</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: But do you believe that now that we&#8217;re in Iraq and Afghanistan that we have some commitment to leave gracefully?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ: </strong>I&#8217;d get out tomorrow.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: So, if it were this logistically possible, you&#8217;d literally take everyone out right now?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Yes.</p>
					<p>And look at what happened just in the last several days where Karzai&#8217;s brother was killed. And openly known&#8211;I mean, all the stories of open corruption associated with him and his dealing&#8211;and kind of implied that he had it coming and that it was almost inevitable.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-10" id="fnref-1395-10">10</a></sup></p>
					<p>And now how&#8217;s this going to work, transitioning out of Afghanistan? Well, what I maintain is that we can have a debate and a discussion about getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan and all the problems associated with it&#8211;getting out tomorrow. All that debate and discussion would be totally valid, but it&#8217;s the same debate and discussion we&#8217;ll have 25 years from now, if that&#8217;s when we finally decide to get out. There&#8217;s just no end to this.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: But, you did acknowledge that you would have intervened in Sudan, so do you think it&#8217;s fair to say that if the American people elect you&#8230; [Governor Johnson interrupted.]</strong></p>
					<p>GJ: Well, I don&#8217;t want to&#8211;Back to Sudan, what were the circumstances? [I said something inaudible, and Johnson agreed.]</p>
					<p>So, to the best of my knowledge, yes, but I hate to misspeak about&#8230; [I interrupted.]</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Yes. I understand that you don&#8217;t have access to the intelligence that the president had at the time&#8230; [Governor Johnson interrupted.]</strong></p>
					<p>GJ: Why didn&#8217;t we intervene? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: I guess what I&#8217;m trying to clarify is that if the American people elected you as President of the United States, that would not be an end to American interventionism in general. You would still intervene in some cases, correct? Could you imagine yourself intervening in some cases?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> I can&#8217;t. I mean, you point out an example where it appears as though we should have intervened, but we didn&#8217;t. And yet, all the interventions that occurred in my lifetime&#8211;I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ve made any difference.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Well, you weren&#8217;t alive for World War II, but I think in World War II we made a difference.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, I said in my lifetime. In my lifetime.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: So, would you argue that because of that, you think it&#8217;s easy to be fooled into thinking that intervention is a good idea, and therefore you would err against intervention?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, yeah. Or the notion that you&#8217;d seek congressional approval for intervention. That seems to me to be a real fail-safe.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: So you would seek congressional approval for any intervention?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s in the Constitution, and what a great check for that kind of decision.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-11" id="fnref-1395-11">11</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>NSD: I don&#8217;t believe that America has formally declared a war since World War II.</strong><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-12" id="fnref-1395-12">12</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> I don&#8217;t believe we have.</p>
					<span id="Chances_of_Winning_the_Election"><h2>Chances of Winning the Election</h2></span>
					<p><strong>NSD: I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re aware of the website <a title="Intrade" href="http://www.intrade.com" target="_blank">Intrade</a>. It&#8217;s an open online futures market. [Governor Johnson indicated that he was.] It&#8217;s certainly far from perfect, but I <strong><a title="Intrade contract: &quot;Gary Johnson to be Republican Presidential Nominee in 2012&quot;" href="http://intrade.com/v4/markets/contract/?contractId=658926" target="_blank">looked</a> </strong>you up there last night, and it said that you had a 0.4% chance of the Republican nomination for president.</strong><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-13" id="fnref-1395-13">13</a></sup><strong> Do you feel that that&#8217;s an accurate characterization of your chances?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> No. No, i don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s better than that. It&#8217;s a lot better than that.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: So, will you bet on it, then?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> I might. Yeah, I might.</p>
					<p>[A brief discussion followed about the legality of such a bet and Intrade in general.]</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Were your lawyer to tell you it was legal, would you bet on yourself?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Yeah because that will increase in value.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: And how will you cause that value to increase?</strong></p>
					<p>GJ: Well, by doing well in New Hampshire, by being top tier of candidates. And by top tier&#8211;whether that&#8217;s 3 or 4 or 5 or whatever it ends up being as opposed to the current 12 or 13.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-14" id="fnref-1395-14">14</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>NSD: And what do you need to do in order to do well in New Hampshire?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, I need money. I need money, and then just keep working like I&#8217;ve been working, which is&#8211;I think New Hampshirites view it as an obligation to go and meet and talk to all potential candidates, and that&#8217;s an environment I should do well at.</p>
					<p>Noah, if I don&#8217;t do really well at that, then that&#8217;s the end of it.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: So if you don&#8217;t end up in the top five candidates in New Hampshire, will you end your campaign?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, when I say top tier&#8211;Politics is about expectation. It&#8217;s about exceeding expectation, and it&#8217;s about having momentum. If you don&#8217;t have those two things, you&#8217;re dead. So, who determines whether or not you have momentum? Well, we do, and I tell you the momentum&#8217;s like that. [Governor Johnson held out his hand, indicating a steep slope.] Nobody would acknowledge that, and why should they? And then exceeding expectations. Well, right now, the expectation for me is 0.4 [percent]. So, am I going to exceed expectation? Yeah, I&#8217;m gonna exceed expectation.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: So you&#8217;re a rare presidential candidate in that you just came incredibly close to publicly admitting that you might not end up the next president of the United States. Would you be willing to admit that?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, 0.4. Come on, come on.</p>
					<span id="Congressman_Ron_Paul"><h2>Congressman Ron Paul</h2></span>
					<p><strong>NSD: I&#8217;ll take that as a yes.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>So, you&#8217;ve been widely compared to Congressman <a title="Wikipedia- Ron Paul" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul" target="_blank">Ron Paul</a>, who&#8217;s running against you in this election. Would you consider him to be a like-minded person?</strong><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-15" id="fnref-1395-15">15</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, I would have endorsed Congressman Paul during the last presidential election, but we&#8217;re different, and he&#8217;s gotta grow way beyond what Ron Paul got <a title="Wikipedia- Ron Paul presidential campaign 2008" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul_presidential_campaign,_2008" target="_blank">last time</a> for the freedom movement, for the liberty movement to prevail.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: So, do you believe that comparisons between you and Congressman Paul are unfounded?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> No, I take them as complimentary, but we&#8217;re not same person.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: How are you different?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, if you just take our resumes, you know, I would have had a thousand employees in a business that I started off as a one person operation&#8211;me.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-16" id="fnref-1395-16">16</a></sup> And then if you want to look at political experience, he registered a lot of very principled no votes as congressman from Texas. My no votes as Governor of New Mexico&#8211;Mine actually put a stop to the legislation. So, unlike being able to be able to register a no vote and that&#8217;s the end of the story is &#8220;I&#8217;ve registered my principled no vote,&#8221; my principled veto actually stopped the legislation, and there was the debate and discussion that went on in the newspapers and in print and on television over why there were going to be carnage in the streets and my claiming that there wouldn&#8217;t be and my getting reelected in an environment where I did this for four straight years, and then I ended up doing it for another four straight years.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Are you arguing that Congressman Ron Paul&#8217;s decisions didn&#8217;t have as much influence on the country as yours?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, in the case as his no votes having an influence on policy, no. [It's clear from Governor Johnson's tone that he meant "No, Congressman Paul's decisions didn't have as much influence on the country as mine."] I mean, my no votes had a lot more impact on a principled&#8211;So, Ron Paul, I don&#8217;t know how many times was he the only no vote in congress. I don&#8217;t know. Unofficially, I think 100 of my vetoes were vetoes of bills where the vote in the legislature in New Mexico was 117 to 0.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-17" id="fnref-1395-17">17</a></sup> You tell me, did his principle no vote, his one no vote among all of Congress have an impact on Congress? No. Did my one vote against 117 yes votes for legislation have an impact on that legislation? Yes, because I stopped it.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Do you think that that suggests that Congressman Ron Paul would act differently as president than you would?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> No. No, it doesn&#8217;t at all. You just asked, &#8220;What is the difference?&#8221;</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: I&#8217;m wondering why you think that people should vote for you instead of Congressman Paul, and if you think that the argument you just presented suggests that they should?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, no. I would never presume to tell&#8211;You asked me what the differences were; I&#8217;m telling you what the differences are.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Well, part of the reason that I&#8217;m asking is because I looked up Congressman <a href="http://intrade.com/v4/markets/contract/?contractId=669534" target="_blank">Ron Paul on Intrade</a> as well, and Intrade gives him a 2.2% chance of winning the nomination. So, while 2.2% isn&#8217;t great, it&#8217;s better than 0.4%. As you know, politics isn&#8217;t just about choosing the candidate that&#8217;s best for the job; it&#8217;s often about choosing the most viable candidate. So, I think if your and Congressman Paul&#8217;s philosophies overlap to a large degree, which you seem to accept, I&#8217;m not sure why people might vote for you instead of Congressman Paul?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, if it&#8217;s splitting up Ron Paul&#8217;s vote, then this isn&#8217;t going anywhere. This has got to attract a number five times what Ron Paul attracted during the last cycle. That&#8217;s how much it has to grow.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-18" id="fnref-1395-18">18</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>NSD: So would you withdraw your candidacy if you were significantly harming Congressman Paul&#8217;s chances of winning?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well if Ron Paul and I are splitting up his eight percent that he got last time, then this is something that&#8217;s going no where.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-19" id="fnref-1395-19">19</a></sup> If Ron Paul and I are splitting up 40% of vote, then yeah, we need to have a sit-down at some point.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Have you spoken to the Paul campaign?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Just to tell them my intentions. This would have been several months ago.</p>
					<span id="More_on_Chances_of_Winning"><h2>More on Chances of Winning</h2></span>
					<p><strong>NSD: So, is it fair to say that you believe you&#8217;re going to get significantly more than eight percent of the vote?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, statistically speaking, I&#8217;m the least known republican.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-20" id="fnref-1395-20">20</a></sup> I mean, that&#8217;s part of the statistics here. I don&#8217;t know if you saw the poll about six weeks ago that was a poll on all the presidential candidates and their approval ratings in their home states. There was only one who had positive approval rating in his or her state: me.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-21" id="fnref-1395-21">21</a></sup> And then about a week ago they came out with a report on presidential candidates&#8217; job creation record. I had the best record in that.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-22" id="fnref-1395-22">22</a></sup> Now, my response to that was &#8220;I didn&#8217;t create a single job as governor of New Mexico.&#8221;</p>
					<p>So, Noah, I&#8217;m making the case that I was really effective as Governor of New Mexico, that I really made a positive difference, that in a state that was two-to-one Democrat, I was recognized for doing that.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-23" id="fnref-1395-23">23</a></sup> And, the more I get known, the better off I am.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Do you view that as your campaign&#8217;s goal right now? To just to get your name out there?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, yeah. Sure, sure.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Is that why you want money? To advertise?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
					<p>Money is the&#8211;So, in New Mexico, the primary was in June, and in February, they did a poll in New Mexico, four months before primary, &#8220;Who would you vote for on the Republican side of the ticket for governor?&#8221; I was at two percent of the Republican vote.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-24" id="fnref-1395-24">24</a></sup> We were ecstatic because, number one, I was on the list, and number two, we hadn&#8217;t entered the phase that I would label as really easy to do and you can really do in quick amount of time, which is going out and actually trying to grab the vote, advertise, spend money.</p>
					<p>So, about 10 days after the poll, we launched into the phase of spending money. Now, it wasn&#8217;t because of the poll; it was because this was our timeline, and about two weeks after having started to spend money, that went from two percent of the Republican vote to 22%&#8211;in like two weeks.</p>
					<p>So, I know how this works, and money is a huge factor in this.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: But, to be fair, advertising in a Republican primary for Governor of New Mexico is a lot easier than advertising in Republican primary for president in New Hampshire.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Why is that? They&#8217;re completely corollary&#8211;totally corollary.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Well, I would imagine that it&#8217;s more expensive, the competition is much stronger, and the position is much larger. You&#8217;re trying to become President of the United States.</strong><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-25" id="fnref-1395-25">25</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Yeah, but the dollars&#8211;Well, no. I would completely disagree with you. The dollars are gonna be very similar. They&#8217;re not going to spend $28 million in New Hampshire. The amount of money that gets spent by my opponents in New Hampshire and myself will be close to being comparable. If it&#8217;s not, then I&#8217;m not in the game.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-26" id="fnref-1395-26">26</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>NSD: You&#8217;ve mentioned New Hampshire a lot, and I&#8217;m guessing anyone from Iowa who reads this interview will wonder why their state wasn&#8217;t mentioned.</strong><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn-1395-27" id="fnref-1395-27">27</a></sup></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, Iowa is a different animal. Iowa is a caucus state. I think that people understand that Iowa is different; they couldn&#8217;t tell you why. And that New Hampshire is, in my opinion, something different, so I&#8217;m putting my chips on the table. Not that we&#8217;re not going to be in Iowa, but&#8230; [I interrupted.]</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Some presidential candidates have accepted that they won&#8217;t do well in Iowa and won&#8217;t compete there. Are you competing in Iowa?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Oh, yeah. We&#8217;ll compete in Iowa. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: But you don&#8217;t anticipate doing as well in Iowa as New Hampshire?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> [Governor Johnson paused.] Right. I mean, Iowa&#8217;s a different animal. It&#8217;s caucus state.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Again, you&#8217;re a very rare presidential candidate in that you&#8217;re willing to anticipate defeat a lot more than others are. Is there a reason for that?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, there&#8217;s being grounded in reality. There&#8217;s the whole notion of being reality-based.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Do you think speaking like that will hurt your chances to becoming president?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, I would hope that speaking what I think is the truth wouldn&#8217;t hurt you ever.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Alright, so I&#8217;ll finish with a softball: Do you play poker?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Well, I&#8217;ve played poker my entire life. Have I ever played it online for money? No.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: But you enjoy the game?</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Yes, well, I&#8217;m a chess guy, and I&#8217;m a backgammon guy, and I&#8217;m a game guy. I&#8217;ve been a game guy my whole life.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Myself as well. We&#8217;ll have to compete at some point.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>GJ:</strong> Yeah.</p>
					<p><strong>NSD: Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to Subject: Poker. That was absolutely wonderful.</strong></p>

But, Article Two, Section Two, Clause One makes the President &#8220;Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy.&#8221; It is a topic of much debate whether the president can start military action without congressional approval, and if so, to what extent. However, since World War II, all wars fought by the United States have <a title="Wikipedia- Declaration of war by the United States" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States" target="_blank">not</a> been formally declared by Congress. <span class="footnotereverse"><a href="#fnref-1395-11">&#8617;</a></span></li>

New Hampshire&#8217;s primary is the first presidential primary every year, although Iowa&#8217;s caucuses typically come before the New Hampshire primary. It is expected to be held on February 14th this year.

														We think that if a presidential candidate is willing to talk to us, we should give him the opportunity. I certainly don&#8217;t think it would be appropriate to refuse to interview someone simply because he is trying to benefit from the interview.</p>
													<p>We&#8217;re trying to provide the poker community with relevant information, and Gary Johnson is relevant to the poker community because he&#8217;s a presidential candidate (albeit a little-known one) who openly supports online poker and Two Plus Two and the PPA have formed relationships with him.</p>

																Gary Johnson is just trying to compete. Go look at his voting record, he is not a sleezy politician. He is a libertarian and by definition he would deregulate poker and we would have pokerstars, fulltilt, harrahs, wynn, all competing and the prices would be lower than the regulated online poker we are heading towards.<br />
																Secondly, he would make a very good VP behind Ron Paul. Ron has a shot at this thing. He has collected more money from individuals than anyone else in the republican campaign and the poker world needs to wake up to the libertarian point of view because it is EXACTLY how we have been living for the last 9 years with online poker. I pray the poker community spends 3 minutes per day listening to youtube clips of Ron Paul and others that will defend the constitution, cut taxes, stop policing the world and stop these insolvent social programs that are dragging our geneation into needless debt. Noah &#8211; Great Interview! I wish we could get the forums behind Dr. Ron Paul.</p>

											<p>What did you personally think of him Noah?</p>
											<p>The situational questions were good, but his answers were less helpful on that part (and rightfully so to an extent given that specific information to the president and those around him likely make or break many options that seem valid to different groups of the public).</p>
											<p>I like his logic on a lot of issues. He&#8217;s probably spot on about intervention in a lot of instances. How many conflicts have we engaged in due to either exploiting those that are now angry at us or friends of our&#8217;s exploiting them? From what Mr. Johnson says, he wouldn&#8217;t be exploiting other countries through aide based deals, but maybe that&#8217;s too narrow of a perspective given the massive economic ties our country will have with so many other countries.</p>
											<p>I like his &#8220;leave it to the states&#8221; position on education (and other issues).</p>
											<p>I guess the hesitations on Johnson would be that he would likely find himself a pretty ineffective president if he vetoed everything congress threw at him. Again, probably too narrow, but at the very least I&#8217;d want to see a guy like this close to the president&#8217;s ear. His logic on some of these subjects is all too lacking in positions of power in this country. I don&#8217;t expect miracles to happen if Johnson were elected, but people would have a lot more choice in their lives, especially locally. And it&#8217;s easier to make a difference in your state than to fight a battle federally, it&#8217;s just too big of a sticker to stretch over 50 states (in my mind).</p>
											<p>Good interview.</p>
											<p>&#8220;used to be an avid reader&#8221; belongs in threads on 2p2 trolling users, your contribution to the comments section here will not be missed. At the very least you can see how the man is relevant in the poker world right now, much more so than UK talking about potentially restructuring licenses around the end of 2012&#8230;</p>
