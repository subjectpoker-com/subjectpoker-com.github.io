			<description>Fixed. Sorry about that, and thanks for pointing it out to us. It should have read &quot;$33.6 billion of which was economic aid and $15.4 billion of which was military aid.&quot; -Noah</description>

			<description>&lt;i&gt;In 2008, the US federal government spent about $49 billion on foreign aid, $33.6 billion of which $15.4 billion was military aid.&lt;/i&gt; wat? Did you mean 33.6bn military and 15.4bn development?</description>

			<description>All, Gary Johnson is just trying to compete. Go look at his voting record, he is not a sleezy politician. He is a libertarian and by definition he would deregulate poker and we would have pokerstars, fulltilt, harrahs, wynn, all competing and the prices would be lower than the regulated online poker we are heading towards. Secondly, he would make a very good VP behind Ron Paul. Ron has a shot at this thing. He has collected more money from individuals than anyone else in the republican campaign and the poker world needs to wake up to the libertarian point of view because it is EXACTLY how we have been living for the last 9 years with online poker. I pray the poker community spends 3 minutes per day listening to youtube clips of Ron Paul and others that will defend the constitution, cut taxes, stop policing the world and stop these insolvent social programs that are dragging our geneation into needless debt. Noah - Great Interview! I wish we could get the forums behind Dr. Ron Paul.</description>

			<description>What did you personally think of him Noah? The situational questions were good, but his answers were less helpful on that part (and rightfully so to an extent given that specific information to the president and those around him likely make or break many options that seem valid to different groups of the public). I like his logic on a lot of issues. He&#039;s probably spot on about intervention in a lot of instances. How many conflicts have we engaged in due to either exploiting those that are now angry at us or friends of our&#039;s exploiting them? From what Mr. Johnson says, he wouldn&#039;t be exploiting other countries through aide based deals, but maybe that&#039;s too narrow of a perspective given the massive economic ties our country will have with so many other countries. I like his &quot;leave it to the states&quot; position on education (and other issues). I guess the hesitations on Johnson would be that he would likely find himself a pretty ineffective president if he vetoed everything congress threw at him. Again, probably too narrow, but at the very least I&#039;d want to see a guy like this close to the president&#039;s ear. His logic on some of these subjects is all too lacking in positions of power in this country. I don&#039;t expect miracles to happen if Johnson were elected, but people would have a lot more choice in their lives, especially locally. And it&#039;s easier to make a difference in your state than to fight a battle federally, it&#039;s just too big of a sticker to stretch over 50 states (in my mind). Good interview. &quot;used to be an avid reader&quot; belongs in threads on 2p2 trolling users, your contribution to the comments section here will not be missed. At the very least you can see how the man is relevant in the poker world right now, much more so than UK talking about potentially restructuring licenses around the end of 2012...</description>

			<description>Haha Noah you were asking some tough questions there. He really doesn&#039;t seem like a great president for me. No intervention at all!?! There&#039;s more important things than poker.</description>

			<description>Used, We think that if a presidential candidate is willing to talk to us, we should give him the opportunity. I certainly don&#039;t think it would be appropriate to refuse to interview someone simply because he is trying to benefit from the interview. We&#039;re trying to provide the poker community with relevant information, and Gary Johnson is relevant to the poker community because he&#039;s a presidential candidate (albeit a little-known one) who openly supports online poker and Two Plus Two and the PPA have formed relationships with him. If I had gone easy on him, then I think that you would have a valid gripe. But, I certainly don&#039;t think that I did.</description>

			<description>What a fuckin asshole, this ultra sleazy politician is, I thought you were a smart guy Noah, but seriously, interviewing someone who is clearly trying to get any votes for his campaign is bad judgement on your part. Ask 1000 people who this guy is, because i would put money on only a very few percent knowing. Total sleazebag. (Not you, him) [I edited this comment to remove the all caps -Noah]</description>
