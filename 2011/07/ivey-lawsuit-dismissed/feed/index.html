			<description>William, Yes. We were quite careful not to say this until we had multiple pieces of evidence.</description>

			<description>Do you have proof that Ivey owns a piece of Full Tilt? if not, I think that statement is pretty careless reporting given the standard you are trying to set.</description>

			<description>Open for what? To take us for a ride one more time? But they will have to return what they owe the players. For now let us bury FTP and just wait for the refunds. If you still enjoy playing poker online, go 888poker or Party...these are legalized play sites where there is no fear of Black Fridays. Well, once stung is good enough for me to never look back on illegal or unregulated poker sites. It was reported that most of the ex-FTPians are now creating huge volumes of traffic in 888poker and party, and why not?</description>

			<description>The most interesting question for me is, What&#039;s the deal with the allegation made by FT in their response to the lawsuit where they accuse Ivey of owing the site multi-millions of dollars. Were these gambling debts? Was the money the FT pros playing with even real? Sometimes watching Gus you would think it was not. Crazy stuff. Thanks for all the hard work getting this together.</description>
