			<description>WOULD A TAX LAWYER OUT THERE READING THIS REPLY COMMENT ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THESE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO UNPAID LOANS. ALSO IF FTP EVER FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY THEN THE COURT APPOINTED TRUSTEE WILL SUE ALL BORROWERS AND RECIPIENTS OF FTP FUNDS UNDER THE CLAWBACK RULES.</description>

			<description>Excellent work Noah! Makes me feel even better about having set a match to my FTP hoodie and ballcap. BTW, I know you weren&#039;t necessarily apologizing per-se in your note below the article, but it just comes across as an overkill justification which in turn seems timid. My opinion...just stay bold and keep putting it out there...no long explanation necessary.</description>

			<description>From my reading, the huge breach of privacy is unnecessarily airing those two Full Tilt pro&#039;s private financial transactions with FTP without permission publicly. Apparently the only reason Subject:Poker did so (because the transactions themselves do not show a crime or foul play) was to provide some weak evidence for the conclusion that &quot;...if these relationships are typical or even exist for a relatively small number of sponsored pros [badly written, just say even exist for a relatively small number of sponsored pros], these loans and payments could have represented a very significant cost to the site.&quot; And frankly you don&#039;t need to reveal specifics to support that last statement. &quot;Two FT Pros&quot; would have worked and also an approximation of the numbers they found would have worked and wouldn&#039;t have put specific private information unnecessarily into the public eye. Also I say &quot;weak evidence&quot; because what Phil Ivey and David Benyamine do isn&#039;t necessarily indicative of what the other Full Tilt pros do, especially the second-tier &quot;red pros&quot;. Even for these two specific pros they can&#039;t say with certainty that they data they have reflects actual amounts owed because of the very limited range of dates for which the transactions are available.</description>

			<description>I think this only hurts the sale if the investor were previously considering keeping a large portion of the staff. The investor might have concerns about the company culture, assuming that this is article is the first time the investor has heard of this data. That said, I doubt this is the first time the investor will have learned of these practices. I doubt a $150M negotiation would occur without thorough investigation of the numbers by the investing group, though I have no experience or knowledge that this is neccessarily the case.</description>

			<description>Reasons we need the raw data: 1. We don&#039;t believe the article 2. We are detail oriented people. Reasons we don&#039;t need the raw data: 1. If we don&#039;t believe the article, why believe the data? 2. Because we are never satisfied anyways. I don&#039;t expect to see the data any time soon, as I don&#039;t see much benefit. Haters gonna hate.</description>

			<description>In response to your questions, &quot;What here is newsworthy?&quot;: &quot;So, if these relationships are typical or even exist for a relatively small number of sponsored pros, these loans and payments could have represented a very significant cost to the site.&quot; This from the conclusions of the article. What is your argument here sir? Are you saying that the above quote is not interesting or important? That&#039;s fine if so, it&#039;s your opinion. But if this is the case you could really consider making your point clear. Why is this not interesting or important? Or, are you saying that the data presented does not substantiate the quote above? If so, please explain why you feel the conclusions are not justified from the arguments presented. Or, do you have moral concerns regarding privacy of personal information which you feel are violated? If so, please explain why you feel this is a &#039;huge breach of privacy.&#039; On this point, I may agree with you - but I wouldn&#039;t know based on your comment above. In general, please refrain from spilling your thoughts into the public realm if you are not going to invest the mental energy to create a meaningful contribution to the dialogue. This is just my general frustration as I read through these comments. No one has presented an argument, but there are several negative comments. All of them share the trait of bringing nothing new to the table other than some incarnation of &quot;I disagree with Noah&quot;.</description>
