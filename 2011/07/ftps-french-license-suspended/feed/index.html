			<description>I have seen the following phrase several times: &quot;players were unable to connect to the client software&quot;. Thats not really correct, better would be something like &quot;players were unable to connect to Full Tilt servers&quot; or &quot;the Full Tilt client software was unable to connect to the servers, therefore not starting&quot;. Anyway, great articles on this site; they seem to be more professionally written than on other sites. Keep up the good work!</description>
