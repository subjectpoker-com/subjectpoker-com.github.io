			<description>The biggest hurdle to a deal is Tapie himself. From trying to delay paying the rest of the world players and short changing them he has now accepted that any future Full Tilt will only succeed if he allows all the Rest of the world players to cash out completely and without penalty if they so wish. The problem now however as always is that he doesnt want to pay what it will cost him ie enough to cover all those player funds and in any case it is to much of his net worth so in reality he cannot afford to take over the liabilities. He desperately needs to find money from somewhere and nobody is prepared to put up that kind of money so the deal is now in very serious doubt because Tapie is just an asset stripper and nobody wants to give him money at the highly inflated cost of more than $200 million beecause he wants to put no more than a maximum of $50 million of his own money into this project. Conclusion this deal is about to die a death</description>

			<description>Lol dont think there is too much positive to take from this news. Its a step in the right direction alright. But looking at the eagerness of Subject Poker, looks like one of its owners has a lot of money stuck at FTP by way of running some bot.</description>

			<description>Best to ask a tax professional, but my understanding is you have to declare winnings by year. As to whether the DOJ would share with the IRS, and the IRS would task someone (several someones I&#039;d guess)to calculate what is owed is something I don&#039;t think anyone knows the answer to. My guess is it would depend on a cost/benefit analysis with some assumptions as to how much in back taxes they can collect. There is also the possibility that the DOJ did not seize enough to cover all of the American players&#039; money. If that&#039;s the case and the DOJ decides to do partial refunds, my guess is the IRS won&#039;t bother trying to figure it all out. If they think there&#039;s a large amount of unpaid taxes they might decide it&#039;s worth going after. And after all, it&#039;s the IRS. They can pretty much do what they want to most people.</description>

			<description>FIRST OF ALL, DON&#039;T HOLD YOUR BREATH. SECONDLY, WILL THE IRS DOUBLE CHECK THE US PLAYERS&#039; PAST TAX RETURNS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY PAID TAXES ON THEIR TRUE NET YEARLY WINNINGS? IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF A US PLAYER CLAIMS THAT HE IS PRESENTLY OWED $1,000,000 BY FTP WHEN ALL ALONG THE US PLAYER HAS CLAIMED ONLY $10,000 OF YEARLY INCOME? WILL THE IRS SUBPOENA FROM FTP THE ACCOUNT RECORDS OF ALL US PLAYERS TO SEE WHAT DISTRIBUTIONS WERE MADE BY FTP TO THEM OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS RELATIVE TO THEIR CLAIMED YEARLY INCOME? IS EACH DISTRIBUTION BY FTP A TAXABLE EVENT?</description>

			<description>What are the chances that FTP will reopen exactly where it left off, with balances, points, medals and rakeback deals restored to RoW players?</description>

			<description>I seem to recall that the DOJ seized 10s of millions of dollars from Full Tilt in the years leading up to Black Friday. Is it possible that the DOJ will use the $40 million from the Tapie Group, the money seized on Black Friday and the previously frozen funds to fully reimburse U.S. players? Does anyone know how much Full Tilt money was seized by the DOJ prior to Black Friday?</description>

			<description>So when will FTP or GBT be up and running? If US is regulated, will Stars and GBT have a say as they are also indicted? Will Party be the force it once was if things fall back in order?</description>

			<description>The DOJ doesn&#039;t levy taxes. That&#039;s the Dept. of Revenue. You already owe taxes on that money, assuming you won, and possibly in some cases if you lost (consult a CPA). If by &quot;tax&quot; you mean, &quot;Will I get less than I am owed?&quot; then yes. The government is not going to pay out one penny more than they seized, and it&#039;s uncertain at best that they seized enough to cover all US balances. And it&#039;s less certain that any sizeable chunk of the money they did seize is even laying around to be distributed.</description>
