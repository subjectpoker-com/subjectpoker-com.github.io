			<description>Great article but don&#039;t you think that the title of the article is a little misleading? The &#039;GBT and DOJ Strike Deal&#039;. You mention later that &#039;Final details are still being worked out&#039; and from what I understand from other news sources, the deal between DOJ and GBT hasn&#039;t been finalised as such,</description>
