			<description>ANY DEAL WOULD IN EFFECT BE SUBJECT TO THE ACTIONS AND CONTROL OF THE DOJ. THAT INLCUDES ALL CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES, ALL CRIMINAL MONETARY PENALTIES AND FINES, AND ALL IN REM FORFEITURES. PLUS THE PLAYERS&#039; REFUNDS. WHERE IS ALL THAT MONEY GOING TO COME FROM? THE ALLEGED BUYERS? THE TEAM FULL TILT MEMBERS?</description>

			<description>very fair and balanced look at this, noah. i&#039;m guessing you don&#039;t want to taint your objectivity with an opinion ... but are those of us who think the Tapie sale is a joke missing a key something? it&#039;s my take that this sale would be contingent on settlement of ray bitar&#039;s and nelson burtnick&#039;s criminal cases -- because no seized funds can come into play without that -- and thus no one from Full Tilt could make a penny on the deal.</description>

			<description>See the article linked in the footnote. We got clarification from the DOJ that their statement applies to all players, including non-US players.</description>

			<description>Noah, Your first footnote suggests that the DoJ may repay players directly. I presume that includes only American players? This might be a cluster, considering there was a 2-3 hour window on Black Friday where FTP allowed transfers, and a large number of U.S. players transferred their funds to trusted international friends in an effort to withdraw. Thoughts?</description>

			<description>Wouldn&#039;t it be a private equity stake (rolls for shares)? Unless it&#039;s a listed public company on a US exchange, the equity pieces for people trading up shares would have nohing to do with SEC or any other regulating commission in the US, unless the Tapie Group is publically held in Europe, then Euro regulators would be involved.</description>
