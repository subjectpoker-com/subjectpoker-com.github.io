			<description>We&#039;ve definitely failed to cover the Absolute Poker story since June. This is laregly because, to the best of our knowledge, there hasn&#039;t been a story to cover. We just didn&#039;t hear about anything relevant happening between June and October 27th. When the KGC put out that statement on October 27th, it took us by surprise. Other sources got the story up before we did, it got a lot of coverage in the various forums, and we tweeted a link to it, so I&#039;m not particularly concerned that many people who would care would learn about the story from us if we wrote about it. We also don&#039;t really know what to make of it and have no additional information, so we don&#039;t have anything to add to the discussion.</description>

			<description>Just politely asking why Subject Poker isn&#039;t talking about the situation at Absolute more and more specifically the alleged liquidation that everybody is talking about? Looks like that&#039;s exactly what this site should be all about. :)</description>

			<description>Jeremy....I hope you are getting paid well. You are obviously a pimp for Howard, Phil, Tom, and company. One ???? for you: Where is the money, cash, in the millions of US Dollars, that Tom Dwan, Phil Ivey, and other FT &quot;Pros&quot; have &quot;borrowed&quot; from FT??? Is it in an escrow account??? No. It is not.</description>

			<description>When I said &#039;negligent police&#039;, I meant the negligent policing of Full Tilt&#039;s accounting in the last few years. If you&#039;re saying AGCC wasn&#039;t capable of regulating an entity the size of Full Tilt, then that&#039;s a whole other can of worms, but is still pretty infuriating that they were supposedly in charge of monitoring players funds.</description>

			<description>That has always been a huge problem, even back in the pre-internet days, and difficult to police. It would be a great article though.</description>

			<description>Alderney has a population of, like, 1400, and they have exactly four police officers. Go to Alderney&#039;s website and you can find their names. Then maybe you can come back and tell us which one should have conducted this investigation -- an investigation which took thousands of man-hours by the DOJ&#039;s legal, forenic accounting, and other experts, as well as compelling the co-operation from several people who were or coud have been charged.</description>
