			<description>I am also very surprised at this article too. Surely if a site recommenced player sign-ups, they would make a grand announcement; I think Merge have made some poor strategic decisions in recent times. I understand that some states have very strict gambling laws, but given the implications post-black Friday, one would have thought it would be a great opportunity for the company to exploit a big gap in the market left by Full Tilt. I think the whole online poker industry needs to make some serious changes to try and re-instate the once renowned levels of integrity.</description>

			<description>The reason Merge is so worried is that the owners of Merge also own Sportsbook.com. Sportsbook internet betting has been illegal in the U.S. for a long time and in fact about 6 people have gone to jail for owning a sportbook site. My guess is that the Merge owners are scared of upsetting the U.S. Department of Justice so they are trying to make it look like they want to comply with all U.S. Internet gaming laws. Merge makes so much money from Sportsbook.com that they aren’t that concerned about their poker business. I dont understand why any US players would want to still play there when you can play on Cake network skins. I do play on one cake network&#039;s skin ( i m not sure if i can name it) and get my withdrawal money within less than 9 days.</description>

			<description>Noah, can you verify if all existing players from those newly banned states are allowed to continue playing? I have had a few players report that they are blocked now as well, but doesn&#039;t seem like a general thing and more like random selection who can and who can&#039;t.</description>

			<description>My understanding is that FTP and others weren&#039;t using non-US payment processors because it&#039;s more expensive to do so. I think this is due in part to the need for making currency conversions.</description>
