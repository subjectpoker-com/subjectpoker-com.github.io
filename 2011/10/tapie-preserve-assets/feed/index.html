			<description>Probably because Full Tilt, according to experts, owns the best online poker software. Additionally, the site is fullly operational. Back in the days, rumor has it that the site would generate more than a a million dollars a day. With Ivey, Antonius, Hansen and Durrr, to name a few, image and integrity still &quot;intact&quot; and considering these are the BIGGEST name in poker (in terms of media exposure)alongside Isildur who is by the way looking for a new sponshorship deal, an attempt to redress Full Tilt is far from a foolish idea. If full Tilt re-emerge, within two years the site will resume its primary activity. A money-making monster. Well, that&#039;s my opinion.</description>

			<description>The DOJ has some of the assets in the U.S. held. They have nothing outside the U.S., but do have court orders in place barring some of the principals from accessing assets outside of the U.S., but those orders only have any real value if those principals intend to continue living in the U.S. (other than in prison). The value of the DOJ&#039;s claims -- assets, software, brand names, etc. -- on anything outside the U.S. is debatable. All the other issues need to be resolved as part of the deal.</description>

			<description>Terminal Poker did exactly that, with a version of Rush Poker and everything. Have you seen their traffic? I hear there was one day when they had almost 70 players. Right now there&#039;s 30 players in the .02-.05 (Euros) Hold&#039;em game. Not quite seeing the &quot;start up your own poker site&quot; as being the road to the gold mine that so many others seem to....</description>

			<description>You&#039;re right, they don&#039;t. The number of people who play online and are oblivious to all these goings on are huge; the number of people who play online and follow the postings on this site and 2+2 is relatively small. The brand really isn&#039;t as tainted as most posters think it is. The brand, the software, and the I.P. are worth a fortune. Without a deal with the D.O.J., the I.P. rights would eventually go to someone else. Make the deal and you get the benefit of all previous advertising, as screaminasian pointed out.</description>
