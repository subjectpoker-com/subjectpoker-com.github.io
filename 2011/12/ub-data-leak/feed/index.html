			<description>I am gob smacked that a company with so many members can have such terrible security as to let somebody access such data so easily. I hope this doesn&#039;t cause too many issues for the online poker community</description>

			<description>I find it astonishing that a company with so many members can be so lax about their security as to let somebody access such data so easily. Given the recent Full Tilt Poker problems, and the subsequent implications for internet poker as a whole, I would have thought other companies would have acted more responsibly. At least nobody has had their financial details revealed but that is a minor consolation. New regulation needs to be introduced.</description>

			<description>What about FTP? It seems like personal data leaked from FTP as well. My email is compromised, I have a lot of spam from gambling sites. Nobody knew this email except FTP.</description>

			<description>The DOJ didn&#039;t seize any .net domains. This isn&#039;t them failing to take an obvious step; its just them not doing something. The .net domains are in theory only for the play money sites, so they&#039;re a bit different legally.</description>

			<description>Maybe someone can help me understand the current status of Ultimate Bet. I think the feds seized ultimatebet.com and ub.com but I still see a site that looks live at ub.net. And it has the UB logo. Is this the same company? Does the continued operation of ub.net mean the feds failed to take the obvious step of seizing related domains? Any light you can shed appreciated.
