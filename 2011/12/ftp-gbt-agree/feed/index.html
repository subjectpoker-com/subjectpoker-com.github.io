			<description>&lt;i&gt;Also its quite astonishing that no administrators have yet to take control of the bankrupt FTP as this is what you expect to happen in cases of fraud but apparently they prefer to have given the various parties time to try and sort this out themselves before moving in as thry will do if this deal falls through.&lt;/i&gt; Haven&#039;t these assets been forfeited to the DoJ already?</description>

			<description>Tapies Accountants are my source. Its a case of the son triyng to impress the father but he hasnt a clue about the poker business and imo he is going to lose his money on this investment but who cares as long as players get their money back. The main problem is he is back to trying to pay as little as possible to the Rest of World Players which will kill off confidence in any new FTP by trying to discourage them from making 100% withdrawals. Only surprising thing is why the FTP owners arent having to contribute more to the players refunds as they are the ones in possession of the player money and Tapie hasnt stolen it but is expected to make good on the stolen money. Also its quite astonishing that no administrators have yet to take control of the bankrupt FTP as this is what you expect to happen in cases of fraud but apparently they prefer to have given the various parties time to try and sort this out themselves before moving in as thry will do if this deal falls through Currently its about 85%+ to come to completion but a reopening is still some way off. Regardless it looks like there is going to be a resolution to all this that will be at least partially favourable to the players but I am not going to be able to make any further comment after this one.</description>

			<description>Finally Tapie Jnr has persuaded Tapie Snr to give him the money to complete the FTP deal Now all we need do is wait and see if he really has accepted that he has to take on the full responsibilty of repaying the Rest of World players in full or whether he reverts to trying to short change them in order to save money but it looks like we now have real light at the end of this tunnel. The old FTP scum can now go rot in hell for the pain and suffering they have inflicted on their innocent victims</description>

			<description>Sincerest apologies but apparently Tapie does NOT have the money to repay players so unless he finds it very soon this deal is DEAD as they need to confirm he is a timewaster just like the last guy and not keep giving this false hope of something good happening and move on to the next potential buyer who will also no doubt conclude the company isnt worth saving. Lets hope all those Full Tilt thieves rot in hell because istr they stated that Tapie definitely had the funds but this was a complete lie.</description>

			<description>STOP PRESS Apparently Tapie has managed to raise the necessary money at the last minute and a fnalized deal will be announced within the next five days. Show me the money is now a realistic proposition.</description>
