			<description>Money has been slowly trickling out of UB/AP in $250 or $500 increments for non-US players. I think some people have managed to get a couple thousand off like that.</description>

			<description>I&#039;m pretty sure UB players got nothing more than some promises of getting money back. I&#039;m sure Noah will correct if I am wrong ... but UB honchos seem to be on the full-on run, while poker players scream little about them because with UB it&#039;s more a matter of -- uh duh, of course, shame on me, i shoulda known better?</description>

			<description>As a non US player I was able to withdraw after black Friday, there would be many non US players in a similar situation, should a liquidator be appointed they should request those funds to be returned for the good of all creditors.</description>

			<description>That would be great if the DOJ paid the players. For those players who never paid taxes for the past 5 years, get ready for a major tax bill when the DOJ shares the info with the IRS.</description>

			<description>Many of us non us players ordered withdrawals after BF. We waited a long time. Then the license was put on hold. We are still waiting. The argument that &quot;non us players had the chance to withdrawal&quot; does not hold. Neither of us not getting paid is not fair.</description>

			<description>He&#039;s returning the 1m+ he was paid for being a sponsored player. Plus some additional sum that was borrowed (because high stakes cash is super swingy and it doesn&#039;t make sense to keep that much in cash).</description>
