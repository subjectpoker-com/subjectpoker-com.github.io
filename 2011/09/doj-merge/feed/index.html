			<description>Noah, I play on Carbon. I just wanted to say thank you for the story you posted. Anyone who can&#039;t understand the multiple reasons you didn&#039;t post your source is a complete moron, IMO. I think your story has given Merge a chance to get our money out of reach of the US Government, at least temporarily, and that is a very good thing. You have delayed what we all know is inevitable. And I for one am very happy to still be able to play. JM</description>

			<description>The US Attorney&#039;s Office is an office of the Department of Justice. The 4/15 seizures/indictments/civil case were all done by the USAO for the Southern District of new York, for example.</description>

			<description>Noah, what gets me isn&#039;t that you posted the article it&#039;s that you twisted the supposed facts. On top of that up until now you had said you were holding off on posting things until you confirmed through multiple sources. Now you&#039;re coming out with something where you can&#039;t name a source. I understand why you have to withhold the source but what I don&#039;t understand is why there is any mention of the doj or use of their logo when this rumor is strictly applicable to the US Attorney&#039;s Office of Maryland? Hearing DOJ involvement is big news to the online poker world and is not what you said you received from your source. Hearing about the US Attorney of Maryland is old news we have been down that path hundreds of times already. The heads up is nice it&#039;s the sensationalizing and including DOJ&#039;s name and logo that is pissing people off.</description>
