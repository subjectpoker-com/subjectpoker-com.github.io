			<description>I&#039;m starting to wonder how much of all those disbursements that have been made is actually left now..and whether the DOJ has any real hope of getting anything. I know we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, but consider this. We know that FTP is severely in the red. It could be anywhere&#039;s between $150 million and a few hundred million more. We know there were around $443 million in disbursements made, and that they also had around $60 million in cash. With all of this talk of &quot;investors&quot;, it makes me wonder why any investor would invest in the company if the shareholders/receivers of the $443 million weren&#039;t willing to re-invest some of that money themselves. If they had done this near the beginning of this &#039;fiasco&#039;, they probably could have resolved it rather easily. But that haven&#039;t done so, and it would seem at face value to be one of the easier things to do, then to approach outsiders. At this stage, it definitely needs a completely new management team, but I don&#039;t understand their logic at all here. Bitar&amp;Co have to be one of the worst management teams in history. How often do you seriously hear of a casino going bankrupt?</description>

			<description>Bernie Madoff&#039;s victims got at least some of their money back. There&#039;s no reason to think that we won&#039;t eventually get at least a portion of it. The circumstances are fairly similar, no?</description>

			<description>How does everyone plan on proving the amounts in their FTP accounts? Are you planning on sending the DOJ a screenshot of the FTP client (that&#039;s all I&#039;ve got) or your bank transactions showing you deposited $15k two days before BF? I could be completely wrong about this, but the DOJ is going to prove that FTP and its officers acted like complete jackasses and criminals and also prove that FTP&#039;s record accounting procedures were a complete sham. At that point, do you think FTP&#039;s internal records are going to be trustworthy? Lets say I deposit $50k via wire 2 days before BF and I end up losing it all challenging the regs, what is to stop me from filing for an injunction to stop the DOJ from paying anyone and arguing FTP&#039;s records are incorrect and unreliable and that I really had about tree fiddy. I may be just pessimistic right now, but I don&#039;t think its gotten as ugly as it&#039;ll get</description>

			<description>+1 There are really three interpretations: 1) FTP owners were negligent (liable in civil context if they can pierce the veil); 2) FTP owners acted in reckless disregard (liable in civil &amp; in some cases criminal); or 3) FTP acted with the intent to use player monies held in trust (liable in civil &amp; guilty in criminal). As a high percentage owner and director (in relation to the other ownership of individually owned shares), they owe a fiduciary duty to the company to be diligent and prudent in its actions and to not willfully disregard the reality. I guess they could prove that there were no signs and they were merely the face of the site, but I doubt very much that these nits didn&#039;t have their hands in everything. They knew or should have known.</description>
