			<description>All I can say is that Full Tilt were stealing player funds way before Black Friday under the guise of cheating - I personally had over $500 dollars taken from my account and my account closed for ? having an association with another player who used a bot. I emailed many times without receiving any response. Maybe the millions they took from players under this guise should also be investigated. Maybe its to late but I think they should look at it. Jail the owners for stealing they do not deserve any pity.</description>

			<description>Gov&#039;t snitch. I don&#039;t see anything else that can be taken from this. He is the unnamed player according to the additions to the article and owes more money than Ferguson, so you would think he would definitely be named in the indictment. Add it all up, and he has turned state&#039;s witness.</description>
