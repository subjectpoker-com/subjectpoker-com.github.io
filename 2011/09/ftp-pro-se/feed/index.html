			<description>The Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) had an obligation (as per what is written in its own mission statement) to enforce what they call, PLAYER PROTECTIONS, with Full Tilt, and all of its licensees. http://www.gamblingcontrol.org/players.php So it seems extraordinarily pathetic, and a conflict of interest, that the AGCC would be ruling on ANYTHING at all relating to Full Tilt. Shouldn&#039;t the AGCC be held equally accountable to poker consumers that have been duped by Full Tilt? Alderney Gambling Control Commission&#039;s promise to players that played on it&#039;s gaming sites was a commitment to prevent EXACTLY what has occurred. So they were either inept, or in on it. Either way, the AGCC should be held accountable. And this means that the AGCC has put itself into a political quagmire, and it seems more likely that the outcome of the hearing will not compromise Full Tilt&#039;s status in the marketplace any more than it already is. Why is there no focus on the AGCC to bear any financial responsibility for not honoring it&#039;s own mission, regarding player protections?</description>

			<description>Misleading article title. In the United States, a corporation cannot represent itself (pro se), with the common exception of small claims court.</description>

			<description>Thanks, appreciate it. Presumably the representation he had in his own case against FTP before they resolved it?</description>

			<description>Why is there no mention of Phillip Ivey in either the motion, being a non-repsondent or having retained separate counsel? Or is he directly mentioned as one of the separate companies like, Filco? Thanks.</description>
