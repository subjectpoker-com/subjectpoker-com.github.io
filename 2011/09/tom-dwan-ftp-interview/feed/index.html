			<description>Everyone hates a cheater. Durr has been duped. He&#039;s like a little kid in shock because his parents forced him to quit little league because he was bad. He&#039;ll give the million+ back, just to have it like it was before. Poor guy. He has to learn the hard way that money is not everything. His reputation is on the line and everyone knows him and what his monstrous corporation Full Tilt has done. Time to severe ties Dwan. They sold you out already. If you stay with them, so goes your rep.</description>

			<description>WOW! Durrr totally sidestepped the question &quot;What caused this shortfall?&quot; He says crediting player accounts???? WTF, did they credit 330 million dollars? There is one pile of money thats a playes pool and one that is a royalties pool, they crossed the line and began taking money from the players pool as royalties. This is like a lawyer getting paid by a client for their services (i.e. players paying the $5 on the $110 hu sngs) and then taking money out of their clients trust accounts (i.e. the full tilt members taking money out of players accounts). Guess what happens to lawyers that do this... THEY ARE DISBARRED AND SENT TO PRISON FOR YEARS. Thats exactly where everyone on the ftp board should go. If they didnt know about the whole, who would? Come on Tom stop defending these criminals.</description>

			<description>Dwan gave this interview for purely selfish reasons. He&#039;s been caught in a jackpot and is trying to figure a way to get out with his reputation and future endorsement money intact. That ship sailed when he put his rep on the line, and borrowed my money, from FT. I&#039;m not buying what Durrr is selling.</description>

			<description>THE FILING OF THE AMENDED CIVIL COMPLAINT BY THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK IS A BRILLIANT MOVE AT THIS TIME. IN THIS CIVIL ACTION THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS (AND YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE) ARE SUBJECT TO ORAL DEPOSITIONS UNDER OATH AND OTEHR DISCOVERY METHODS WITH WHICH THEY MUST COMPLY AS MANDATED BY COURT RULES OR ELSE THEY WILL DEFAULT AND A JUDGMENT WILL BE ENTERED AGAINST THEM. OF COURSE THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS WILL NOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AND WILL ASSERT THE 5TH AMENDMENT AGAINST SELF INCRIMINATION. BUT THAT IS NOT A DEFENSE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE CIVIL ACTION WHICH WILL PROCEED FORWARD AGAINST THEM. ALSO ONCE THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS ARE LEGALLY SERVED WITH THE SUMMONS AND THE AMENDED COMPLAINT THEY CAN DISAPPER FROM THE SCENE BUT THE CIVIL ACTION WILL PROCEED FORWARD IN THEIR ABSENCE. IN OTHER WORDS IT MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD IDEA FOR THE US ATTORNEY TO FILE CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST THESE INDIVIDUALS AT THIS TIME UNTIL THE CIVIL ACTION IS COMPLETED (OF COURSE SUBJECT TO THE CRIMINAL STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS)</description>

			<description>My understanding from the interview is that Dwan has now upped his repayment offer to include both the initial $1M he pledged plus the amount he owes FTP from loans, which he indicates is close to $1M as well. So that makes a total of close to $2M that he&#039;s vowed to repay to the players.</description>

			<description>That was a fantastic interview. Felt like there were no softball questions and Dwan not answering every question is understandable.</description>

			<description>Sorry Tom, but it sounds like this whole interview is about positioning yourself. Whereas Chris and Howard may be lounging on an island somewhere, you apparently hope to stay where you are. If they(DOJ) are not asking you any questions, then it is definitely because they already know the answers, at least concerning you. As your attorney, which I am not, I would advise you to be quiet. I&#039;ll look for the follow up to your intverview, but I would expect that you should seek refuge, and just be quiet. There is no upside for you here, and if you are trying to protect yourself, then you are wrong in doing so. I have enjoyed watching you play, and poker is a great game - but you are not likely to be considered to be an attribute to the game by discussing these issues unless you have something to really contribute. Other than that, just staying out of this fight - because you might become at least collateral damage. Good luck though to you in any case. Dr.</description>

			<description>Interesting that he only offers to give back a million when that is the amount he owes to FTP in loans that he took from them,</description>
