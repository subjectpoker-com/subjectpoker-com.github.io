			<description>I hope this news is true because a line needs to be drawn under this sorry saga. Internet gaming, particularly poker, has suffered a massive blow to its credibility and I hope, if rumours are true, that this French investment group are able to restore some trust. I also hope that full tilt users are reimbursed soon.</description>

			<description>Whether or not any investor is indeed seriously involved in the process of purchasing FTP, is based upon whether or not the FTP brand has value, and I dont think we have enough information to have an educated opinion about that. First and foremost because FTP has never been audited, secondly because its difficut to predict what kind of effect a scandal like this has on any brand value that potentially was there before.</description>

			<description>we share the same exact opinion on each front regarding this situation! if i would have 500mio laying around somewhere i&#039;d insta-snap buy FTP and make millions off of it. no illegal activities needed. gl with your potential relocation, see you at the virtual tables.</description>

			<description>+1. This is the same Jeff Ifrah who petitioned the US District Court to allow his firm to be relieved as attorneys for the defense in the Segal class action suit. (S:P has the story here -  http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/09/ftp-pro-se/) So, this story is either another FT head fake or, perhaps, a ray of hope and a brilliant PR move. Not to be cynical, but reality hasn&#039;t been kind to the &#039;ray of hope&#039; stories FT has pushed out since April. One thing missing from all this analysis: a reconstituted FT (even if rebranded) will not be able to reclaim its US player base. For any online poker site, what does a post-Black Friday balance sheet look like without US players? Certainly, it&#039;s profitable... but is it profitable enough to do what these French investors are purporting to do?</description>

			<description>So if my reading comprehension is right: Jeff Ifrah met with and spoke to DiamondFlush and personally showed him documents between Full Tilt poker and the unnamed group of investors (which WickedChops says is Laurent Tapie)? I&#039;m having a hard time wrapping my head around the reason for the leaking of this information by Ifrah, other than to slightly appease the poker community after the new allegations have surfaced. Are the FT guys really selling, or are they stalling the players and the authorites while they make arrangements to move to Zimbabwe??? No offense, but a sale has been &quot;imminent&quot; for months, and every time some damning evidence is produced suddenly Full Tilt becomes very vocal and claims the final stages of a deal are in the offing.</description>

			<description>I really hope this happens. There is possible upside in offering sportsbetting and casino services to the non us player base. I am sure they are looking at that. Also, I really hope they will honour affiliate contracts as they are.</description>

			<description>Seriously, this is way too good to be true. We all wanted to hear it. Some evil genius decided to time it shortly after the hearing and BANG! we are all supposed to get a new sense of hope. Bullshit.</description>
