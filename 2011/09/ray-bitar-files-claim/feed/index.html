			<description>Great points. I&#039;ve thought the exact same thing. Now some of those plays that Gus and Dwan made make sense....they were playing with my money. It would be funny if it wasn&#039;t so sick. It&#039;s a lot easier to bluff when you&#039;re playing with funny money. When will they be arrested? And I&#039;m not just talking about Bitar, Lederer and Ferguson.</description>

			<description>Just look at Tony G, he seems to get TV appearances and sponsorship deals just fine despite the fact that he scammed tons of players with T6 poker.</description>

			<description>I really think those of us owed money by FT need to shine the spotlight on Phil Ivey, Tom Dwan, and every other poker player out there who owe FT money. I also want to make it clear to Ivey, Dwan, and the others that their days as marketable pros are over. You were paid endorsers of a company that stole my money while you borrowed my money. No site, present or future, will ever want any part of you.</description>

			<description>Trust me, the &quot;investor&quot; deal is a ruse. They guy who is supposedly the buyer has been convicted of fixing sporting events and fraud, and not only that but the agreement says that everyone must be paid back first. This will NEVER happen. He is a friend of Bitar&#039;s who is just trying to muddy the waters. There IS no real offer, there IS no real deal, and our money IS already in the pockets of thieves.</description>

			<description>He must have thought he was going to have his golden goose forever. He does not present himself very well. &quot;My interest in these above-referenced properties is legal and equitable ownership, an ownership interest acquired by my lawful establishment of those entities and my entirely lawful hard work performed for said companies over the years&quot; Some pretty crazy stuff still coming out of the wood work. Kind of annoying after having paid 5 figures of rake that they do not have my 4 figure account balance.</description>

			<description>I met him a few times in my short tenure at FT. He was always a dodgy bastard, I just didnt realise how crimina/incompetant the American management were (in stark contrast to the people who built the business).</description>
