			<description>What can I say? Serves them right...I hope they get some good jail time considering they were robbing innocent people&#039;s hard earned money. I love how Jeff Ifrah was fighting till the very end begging people to send e-mails to the AGCC asking them not to suspend Full Tilt’s license. lol as if anyone would do that considering how &quot;trustworthy&quot; they are. Rakefree poker rooms are the only poker rooms worth playing anyway. I recently switched and am pleasantly surprised on how much I save on rake and the decent amount of players. Was stuck playing fulltilt and Pokerstars thinking it&#039;s better to play in the big popular rooms....but little did I know. Just my two cents.</description>

			<description>The problem with your comment is it is simply in your opinion that AGCC failed to do it&#039;s work. Given they had given FTP warnings in the past perhaps they were fulfilling their oversight role per their Ordinance. The oversight on them comes from the Alderney government. It will be up to them to investigate any failings on behalf of the AGCC. What were the SFC&#039;s penalties post Lehman&#039;s? Or the FSA&#039;s at the same time? None. But they id re-write their code of practices&#039; to try and ensure better practice in the future. It is perfectly possible that the AGCC&#039;s approach is current global best practice and they adhered to it throughout FTP&#039;s demise. It remains to be seen what failings they had as a regulator - but they have established they were being lied to by FTP on several occasions in their findings.</description>

			<description>Is it possible for individual players to take action vs the AGCC on any grounds? Not implying that this last decision was bad for players and that the FTP claims that this affects the negotiations badly are true, but regardless I just think in general the comission has failed badly to do it&#039;s work properly during this whole mess, and the 2 years leading into it. Is there any way to make them answer for it?</description>

			<description>It seems to me that a Category 1 licence allows, &quot;authorises the organisation and preparation of gambling operations, namely the registration and verification of players, the contractual relationship with them, and the management of player funds.&quot; This would be far more easily acquired a Category 2 which would require more Due Diligence as it, &quot;authorises the effecting of the gambling transaction including operational management of a gambling platform located within an approved hosting centre&quot; Essentially you need both which the FTP group split. If the Oricic only got it&#039;s Category 1 three months ago it is not unreasonable they&#039;re still waiting on the 2. Also there is someone considered unfit (Presumably a Filco et al) associated with them currently.</description>

			<description>I have a feeling you thought they were manufacturing certain cards to certain players, which is not that case. As for prison time here, they deserve some, definitely, but I wouldn&#039;t quite wish life on them.</description>

			<description>I am soo happy to hear the FTP is going down. I knew for years that the site was dodgy and to finally see them go down is so satisfying I am so pleased. To hell with Full Tilt poker!!! I told them in an email about 1 year ago that I had a feeling they was operating wrong and I told them 1 day they would suffer. HAHAHAHA F*&amp;K YOUUU FULL TILT</description>
