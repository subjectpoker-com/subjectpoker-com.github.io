			<description><![CDATA[Subject: Poker will not be publishing any more articles. Currently, Thomas Bakker and I are starting a poker security consulting company.1 As a result, I can no longer guarantee my independence as editor-in-chief. Subject: Poker&#8216;s founding principle is independence, so it would be inappropriate for me to continue Subject: Poker. The website will stay up with all articles intact for the foreseeable future, but it will naturally become a bit of a relic as time passes and no new articles are added. I hope that it will continue to prove a useful resource for the poker community. Diamond Flush has decided to start a new poker news site, Diamond Flush Poker. Diamond has been an incredible member of our team who&#8217;s written many of our most important articles, including the first story to mention Full Tilt&#8217;s french investor; our story correcting the AGCC&#8217;s false numbers; all stories related to the pending deal between GBT, FTP, and the DOJ; our recent story exposing Chris Ferguson&#8217;s secret bank accounts; and many others. DFP will be inheriting much of our data, sources, and research as well. We look forward to getting our news from there, and we recommend that our readers do the same.

			<description><![CDATA[From at least April of 2007, Chris Ferguson funnelled just under $60 million of his Full Tilt distribution payments into bank accounts held for him in the name of Pocket Kings Ltd,1 in addition to the roughly $25 million that the US Department of Justice reported that he received in their amended civil complaint. He successfully withdrew or spent about $45 million of this funnelled money, but about $14.3 million of it was used for Full Tilt&#8217;s post-Black Friday expenses, reportedly with his permission. In an attempt to recover this money, Ferguson and his lawyer, Ian Imrich, have threatened repeatedly to take steps that might impede the pending deal with the DOJ and Groupe Bernard Tapie. Ferguson&#8217;s Accounts Ferguson&#8217;s distributions were paid mostly into accounts that Pocket Kings held for him. These accounts were unambiguously controlled by him, and were typically referred to as &#8220;Chris&#8217;s accounts.&#8221; For example, his April 2007 distribution was about $1.3 million, $400,000 of which went to his personal account and about $900,000 of which went to a PK account. His March 2011 distribution was about $1.9 million, $600,000 of which went to his personal account and about $1.3 million of which went to a PK account.

			<description><![CDATA[Subject: Poker can now confirm that Full Tilt Poker and Groupe Bernard Tapie have executed an agreement to further the transfer of FTP&#8217;s assets to GBT. This agreement was necessary to pave the way for the US Department of Justice to take possession of the assets voluntarily being forfeited by Full Tilt. This was the next step in the complicated process of transferring Full Tilt assets (by way of the US Department of Justice) to Groupe Bernard Tapie. It follows the November 17th agreement between DOJ and GBT that allows GBT to purchase forfeited FTP assets from the DOJ, likely via the Asset Forfeiture Fund, for an agreed-upon price of $80 million.  In return, GBT also agreed to repay or otherwise make whole non-US players, who are owed over $150 million. The DOJ has agreed to dismiss the civil complaints for forfeiture against the FTP companies when and if the forfeiture of the assets is complete.  The DOJ would then be responsible for Full Tilt&#8217;s liability to US players, which is also estimated to be about $150 million.1 Multiple sources report that Full Tilt&#8217;s ownership held a vote on this agreement, and owners representing a majority of shares agreed to the deal.

			<description><![CDATA[Following the longest two and a half weeks for online poker players since Black Friday, Subject: Poker can confirm that the US Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York, and Group Bernard Tapie have signed their letter agreement, allowing for the acquisition of the assets of Full Tilt Poker by GBT once FTP have inked their side of the agreement. Mr. Behn Dayanim, the Washington, D.C. attorney for GBT in this matter, offered the following statement to Subject: Poker: We have an executed letter agreement with the Department of Justice that would allow GBT to purchase the Full Tilt assets from the United States. This is the first step in a process that will require agreement of the Full Tilt companies to the forfeiture of those assets and execution of a definitive agreement with the Department. Mr. Jeff Ifrah, Full Tilt&#8217;s attorney, echoed Dayanim&#8217;s enthusiasm with the following comment also made to Subject: Poker: The historic agreement between DOJ and GBT lays out the terms of sale, requires GBT to reimburse ROW players, and details the procedure proposed to reimburse US players. But there is still work to do and of course important questions remain. When will the assets be forfeited [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/11/doj-gbt-ink/' addthis:title='BREAKING: DOJ and GBT Ink Their Deal, FTP/GBT Next in the Queue ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Full Tilt gave Subject: Poker the following statement earlier today: Full Tilt Poker is pleased that the terms of the agreement between Groupe Bernard Tapie (GBT) and the Department of Justice have been finalized, and that the agreement provides forGBT to repay or make whole players outside of the United States and provides a mechanism for U.S. players to get repaid.Since Black Friday, repaying customers has been FTP’s number one priority. Ray Bitar, co-Founder and CEO of Full Tilt Poker stated: “I am extremely pleased with the efforts of the Department of Justice, and the Groupe Bernard Tapie corporation, and appreciate their continued dedication in working towards a mutually beneficial agreement that will facilitate repayment of the players .” Now that the agreement with DOJ has been reached, GBT and Full Tilt Poker will now turn to memorializing the final terms of their agreement, to bring this matter to a complete resolution as soon as possible. Full Tilt Poker would like to thank all its customers for their continued patience since Black Friday and during this negotiation process.

			<description><![CDATA[After weeks of waiting, Subject: Poker can confirm that Groupe Bernard Tapie and the US Department of Justice have come to terms that allow GBT&#8217;s acquisition of Full Tilt Poker to continue. If FTP&#8217;s current shareholders agree to acquisition of their company, this deal with the DOJ will provide for payment of all players worldwide. Multiple sources have confirmed to S:P that the following email went out this morning to Tiltware shareholders from Ray Bitar: Dear members, I am pleased to announce that today the Department of Justice and Groupe Bernard Tapie have reached an agreement in principle regarding the acquisition of the companies comprising FullTiltPoker. My understanding is the deal provides that in exchange for an agreed upon payment by GBT, and a GBT commitment to assume responsibility for payment of ROW players, DoJ will reimburse US players and settle the outstanding civil litigation with the companies comprising FTP. Beyond these conditions, issues like the time frame and process for repayment of players remain unclear at this point and time. With DoJ&#8217;s consent now in hand, GBT may now proceed to finalize an agreement to acquire the companies or assets that comprise FTP.  That agreement will very likely address [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/11/breaking-gbt-doj-deal/' addthis:title='BREAKING: GBT and DOJ Strike Deal, FTP Sale Pending ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The Alderney Gambling Control Commission&#8217;s report that the US Department of Justice had seized $331 million from Full Tilt Poker over almost four years is false. Subject: Poker believes that the real number is about $159 million.1 Approximately $35-$45 million was seized from FTP on April 15th. Following ten days of hearings and deliberation, on September 29, the Alderney Gaming Control Commission revoked three of the four licenses belonging to Full Tilt Poker. In a detailed determination notice attached to the revocation announcement, the AGCC made this incorrect statement: The individual seizures made by the Department of Justice during the period 28th June 2007 to 20th June 2011… amount to a cumulative total of approximately $331 million US Dollars. This number is much higher than the $115 million that Full Tilt reported was seized in the two years before Black Friday combined with the $60 million that the DOJ reported was in Full Tilt’s bank accounts on March 31st (about $10 million of which went to April 1st distribution payments to shareholders). The actual total amount of money seized by the DOJ as recorded by FTP in its internal accounting for that four year period amounted to $158,793,000, much less than the $331 million that the AGCC [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/10/agcc-331m-wrong-159m/' addthis:title='AGCC Falsely Reported $331M, Real Number $159M ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Correction posted 10/5/2011 8:06 PM EST. In light of some widespread rumors that are running rampant across the internet regarding the acquisition agreement between Groupe Bernard Tapie (GBT) and Full Tilt Poker, Subject: Poker has contacted several of our sources to get clarity. There is indeed a tentative agreement to purchase Full Tilt Poker that&#8217;s been signed by all parties. As is to be expected, it&#8217;s a provisional agreement, where certain contingencies must be met. The agreement was executed on September 30, when the previously reported letter of intent was due to expire. In an interview with Behnam Dayanim, an attorney for GBT Managing Director Laurent Tapie, Dayanim stressed that the Groupe is focusing on moving forward to complete the sale and maintains its aim to see that Full Tilt customers are repaid the account balances that are due to them. Bernard Tapie, Laurent&#8217;s father and owner of GBT, said in an interview with Agence French Presse that his company was only willing to finance 5%-10% of the sale on its own. Mr. Dayanim insists that is not true at all. While there are outstanding issues that need to be resolved, not the least of which is an agreement with the US Department of Justice, [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/10/ftp-acquisition-agreement/' addthis:title='FTP Acquisition Agreement, Fact vs Fiction ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Tom &#8220;durrrr&#8221; Dwan is one of the best-known players of nosesbleed-stakes poker and the newest member of Team Full Tilt. On April 16th, his friend Phil Galfond decided to guarantee $1 million of Stars and Full Tilt payouts to players, and Dwan decided to match it. Dwan has since raised this to the amount that he earned in sponsorship money from Full Tilt Poker, an amount that he says is higher than $1 million. He had otherwise been relatively quiet about Full Tilt until the DOJ amended their civil complaint on Tuesday to include requests for damages from Howard Lederer, Chris Ferguson, and Rafe Furst and provide much more information about why Full Tilt has so far failed to repay players. Now, he says that he is freed from an NDA and able to talk freely. Before starting this interview, Dwan asked me to ask him probing questions. He explained that, though he would not answer every question, he wanted to be as candid as possible and was comfortable refusing to answer when he felt it was necessary. The Interview Three questions came up that, for reasons explained in the interview, Dwan was not comfortable answering extemporaneously at the time: [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/09/tom-dwan-ftp-interview/' addthis:title='Interview with Tom &#8220;durrrr&#8221; Dwan about FTP ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Most recent update: 9/20 at 4:37 PM EDT. The US Department of Justice has amended its Black Friday civil complaint to include discussion of alleged &#8220;Full Tilt Poker&#8217;s and the FTP insider defendants&#8217; theft of player funds.&#8221; The new complaint adds three new defendants, Howard Lederer, Chris Ferguson, and Rafe Furst. It also alleges that these new defendents together with Ray Bitar committed money laundering, and asks for penalties ranging from $12M for Furst to $42M for Lederer. A memorandum summarizing the amendment says, The Amended Complaint alleges that one of the Poker Companies, Full Tilt Poker, not only engaged in the operation of an unlawful gambling business, bank fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering as alleged in the Complaint, but also defrauded its poker players by misrepresenting to players that funds deposited into their online player accounts were secure and segregated from operating funds, while at the same time using player funds to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars to Full Tilt Poker owners. Full Tilt Poker was able to accomplish this massive fraud, in part, because it illegally conducted business in the United States but maintained its personnel, operations, assets, and accounts principally overseas.
