			<description><![CDATA[Subject: Poker will not be publishing any more articles. Currently, Thomas Bakker and I are starting a poker security consulting company.1 As a result, I can no longer guarantee my independence as editor-in-chief. Subject: Poker&#8216;s founding principle is independence, so it would be inappropriate for me to continue Subject: Poker. The website will stay up with all articles intact for the foreseeable future, but it will naturally become a bit of a relic as time passes and no new articles are added. I hope that it will continue to prove a useful resource for the poker community. Diamond Flush has decided to start a new poker news site, Diamond Flush Poker. Diamond has been an incredible member of our team who&#8217;s written many of our most important articles, including the first story to mention Full Tilt&#8217;s french investor; our story correcting the AGCC&#8217;s false numbers; all stories related to the pending deal between GBT, FTP, and the DOJ; our recent story exposing Chris Ferguson&#8217;s secret bank accounts; and many others. DFP will be inheriting much of our data, sources, and research as well. We look forward to getting our news from there, and we recommend that our readers do the same.

			<description><![CDATA[Subject: Poker is quite proud to announce that we&#8217;ve finally got ourselves a new logo! Our logo contest was unquestionably a huge success. We received a lot of really awesome logos with a wide variety of design ideas, and almost all of the entries would have made a great logo for this site. Though we were absolutely terrified to have to choose (especially considering that we don&#8217;t have good eyes for this sort of thing), one logo just stood out above the rest. You can see it looking beautiful at the top of our page. The logo was designed by Drew Scherer. He&#8217;s a graduate student studying architecture, which doesn&#8217;t surprise us, given his obvious design abilities. Before Black Friday, Drew was a NL200 six-max grinder as well. If you&#8217;d like to get in contact with Drew, you can e-mail us at team@subjectpoker.com and we&#8217;ll put you in touch with him. We&#8217;d like to express our thanks to Drew for creating this awesome logo! In fact, he deserves extra credit for also designing the sweet logo featured at the top of this announcement and on our Twitter page. So, he went above and beyond the call for us, and we [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/06/sps-new-logo/' addthis:title='S:P Has a New Logo!

			<description><![CDATA[The current poker news landscape is dominated by sites and magazines whose bottom lines depend directly on the news makers, which naturally leads to bias. There are some smaller independent outfits, but these tend to be driven mostly by opinion, gossip, and rumors, and they have their own biases. Many people simply bypass the poker media completely and instead wade through the Two Plus Two Forums. While 2+2 provides a wonderful resource, it is a discussion forum and not a news site and is thus difficult and time-consuming as a news source. It&#8217;s also nearly impossible for people who aren&#8217;t extremely well-acquainted with the subtleties of 2+2 to separate signal from noise. As a result, at a time when the poker world is attempting to absorb immense quantities of complicated and important news, the community is starved for good information and solid analysis. Enter Subject: Poker. S:P has a very simple goal, embodied by our slogan: &#8220;Poker news done right.&#8221; A lot of thought has gone into how to provide you, our readers, with the best possible poker news site. We&#8217;ll describe a small subset of our many important founding principles here: Independence First and foremost, Subject: Poker is completely independent.

			<description><![CDATA[You may have noticed that there&#8217;s a hideous void at the top of this page. Indeed, we&#8217;re a site without a logo. And frankly, it&#8217;s a bit embarrassing. We&#8217;re reporters, analysts, poker players, and many other things, but unfortunately, we are not artists. So, we&#8217;re reaching out to the community for help on this one and holding a contest to see who can design us the best logo. We know that a lot of you have some pretty awesome design skills, and we&#8217;re excited to see what you come up with. We ask that you please include our full name (colon and all), and we&#8217;d love it if you could fit our slogan, &#8220;Poker news done right,&#8221; in there, though that&#8217;s not a requirement. The only real advice that we have is to keep it simple and sleek. (As you can see by our fairly minimalist theme, we don&#8217;t want our design to distract from our content.) To submit an entry, e-mail it to team@subjectpoker.com. The creator of the best entry will be featured in an announcement on the site showcasing his or her logo. More importantly, the winner gets a permanent mention on our About Subject: Poker page and, [...]<div addthis:url='http://www.subjectpoker.com/2011/05/subject-poker-logo-contest/' addthis:title='Subject: Poker Logo Contest ' class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style addthis_32x32_style"><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a><a class="addthis_button_reddit"></a><a class="addthis_button_digg"></a><a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a><a class="addthis_button_compact"></a></div>]]></description>
