			<description>First of all, congratulations on your new venture, which makes your departure from &quot;Subject:Poker&quot; logical. Good luck in your new venture. Please try to find someone that can take &quot;Subject: Poker&quot; on and make it grow. There some great people out there that could do it. Sell it and get paid over ten years! You have done such a good job it is sad to see you stop like this :)</description>
